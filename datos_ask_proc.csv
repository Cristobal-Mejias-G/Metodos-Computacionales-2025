[When you control your lust you...](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/s/qkC4ixrPZh)

Thats when you realise how boring most women are. Not all of them and the problem with that is still seeing women as objects but that says a lot about how you value women. Do you find them interesting to be with or do you find them interesting because you just look at them lustfully. When you start treating women like people that's when they become a lot more boring. She has to at that point have to have a personality, not just looks. I often find that I'm not very interested in women or men in a sexual sense. No, I'm not asexual. I just don't find it interesting to find someone only to have sex with. We're humans, not animals. All reading this. I highly doubt anyone's dog or cat is reading this. 😝Like they say:

AskMen,photo_inbloom,1npvcs7,Do you actually like when a woman wears lingerie? Why or why not?,461,1,572,ForYourAuralPleasure,ng4pnpy,"Lingerie is a lot like a Darth Vader costume. 

(Don’t abandon me yet)

Darth Vader has an imposing, intimidating aesthetic, but if you’ve ever watched pre-production footage in which you can hear the David Prowse voice instead of the James Earl Jones voice, or maybe videos of folks in exquisite replica Vader outfits doing TikTok meme dances or whatever, the character loses some of the aura the outfit gives. 

Lingerie is very much the same. It’s a single part of a total curated atmosphere. If you show up in lingerie without the lingerie voice or the lingerie attitude, it’s not going to do much for anyone who doesn’t somewhat fetishize the clothing itself.

To that end, if wearing lingerie allows a woman to feel sexy, and that translates to the way she carries herself, the way she speaks, the way she engages, that is VERY sexy. You might read that and say “well I could do all that in whatever outfit puts me in that mindset,” and deduce that the lingerie itself is unnecessary, and… yeah, if you don’t need lingerie to show that side of yourself to your partner, chances are good the lingerie isn’t going to do much. If that side ONLY comes out in the lingerie, it’s probably going to give the impression that the lingerie itself is responsible. 

Could just be me, though.",1,2025-09-25,11:13:28

Obviously sandwiches are pretty big but you can absolutely switch them up so they don't get boring. I like to use different lunch meats and different combinations of toppings to make them feel different instead of just ham and cheese with mayo everyday (or anything the same everyday just gets old) 
Using different types of bread or making wraps sometimes helps break it up too.

Another easy thing to pack is dinner leftovers and the easiest types of things to eat fast are usually ""one pan"" meals. Things like any kind of pasta or soup, or maybe rice and meatballs. But ideally I leave out anything that would be spoiled by heating it up like maybe if there is a sour cream with the meal I just leave it out or have it in a covered side dish inside the lunchbox that so I can put it on after I heat up the food.

I hope this helps some and I have a bunch of recipe cards from Hello Fresh that I used in the past so if you want any specific recipe ideas with instructions feel free to pm me and I can send you some of the ones I have 😁",1,2025-09-25,17:55:04

AskMen,theonekl2244,1nqi39z,"For blue collar men, what do you take for lunch to keep you going?",189,0,129,12altoids34,ng74ku5,"It depends on whether you just want to make sure that he has food or whether you want him to appreciate the fact that you packed him a lunch. If he's Blue Collar then there's a high likelihood that he might have a brake truck available at break times to get something if he has a little money. Some people go overboard and spend a lot of money on a brake truck. I used to go relatively cheap I could get two croquettes a bun and a packet of mayonnaise and make a croquet sandwich that I enjoyed with a soda for less than five bucks. Unfortunately I'm the type of person that can eat the same thing every day and if I like it I don't get tired of it.

But if you're wanting to go out of your way to do something special for him so that when he goes to eat it he knows that you have thought of him and tried to take care of him then my primary suggestion is first off something to drink. If he's a coffee drinker maybe get him a thermos so he has coffee to drink all day. If he's not a coffee drinker you can pack him cold drinks. Gatorade bottles can be filled 2/3 with water and Frozen to add as ice blocks without the bottle breaking. If you fill the Gatorade bottles up they may overflow or break. I specifically mentioned Gatorade bottles because most bottles will crack or explode if you freeze water in them. Gatorade bottles typically won't.

You could also get him a large thermos or insulated cup to have water or juice to drink throughout the day. If he likes sandwiches you could pack him a couple sandwiches. If you're using Gatorade for ice it will prevent the sandwiches from getting nasty in the heat. One thing I would suggest if you're making sandwiches do more than just a slice of cheese and a slice of meat. Put some lettuce or tomato and maybe mustard mayonnaise something to show that you have put a little work into it rather than just slapping a slice of cheese and a slice of meat on a piece of bread. You also want to make sure that there's a sweet treat in there. Not necessarily to fill him up but as a little treat and to remind him that you care. Something as simple as a couple Oreos or a candy bar can go a long way towards that. If he is a ""grazer"" you might throw in a small bag of celery sticks or carrot sticks that he can keep in his pocket and munch on throughout the day. If he has a sweet tooth maybe it would be a bag of small candies. Whatever it is bear in mind that he may be working in an area where there's no air conditioning and things may get hot. Individually wrapped candies will often get stuck to the wrapper and be more of a pain in the ass than a treat.

If you're packing him a lunch the one thing I would bear in mind is always try to have some variety. You don't want him thinking that you just slapping the same thing together everyday. Well he still might appreciate that you made him lunch he might appreciate it more knowing that you were always trying to give him variety and keep him happy and not hungry",1,2025-09-25,18:11:05

AskMen,Amazing_Guarantee565,1npw0g9,"What would you do in this situation (Bali hotel, possible domestic violence)?",61,0,111,AutoModerator,ng2caud,"Here's an original copy of /u/Amazing_Guarantee565's post (if available):

My girlfriend and I just arrived in Bali — it was our first night in the hotel. When we checked in, we saw a white woman (looked European) with really bad bruises all over both of her legs. Later that night, from our room, we clearly heard a woman screaming for a long time, loud banging, then later just occasional coughing every 20 minutes or so. It sounded like she was being beaten.

I called reception during the night, told them what I heard, and asked them to call the police. When I opened my door I even said loudly, “Someone is being attacked, please call the police.” The guy at reception said “yeah will do,” but I have no idea if they ever actually called.

This morning, I went down to reception to follow up. They kind of laughed and said “oh, it’s just a husband and wife situation, it’s okay now.” They brushed it off like it wasn’t serious.

I feel really unsettled. I don’t know if the police ever came, if the woman is safe, or if the hotel just doesn’t care. On the one hand, it’s not my country, I don’t know how the police here operate, and I don’t want to put myself in danger by taking matters into my own hands. On the other hand, I can’t stop thinking about the bruises I saw and the screams I heard.

My question for you guys: What would you do in my situation? Push harder with the hotel, go straight to the police/Tourist Police, or drop it since I’m technically “just a guest”?

She was from the UK and I'm not sure about him. He had dark hair, dark skin. One night he beat her so bad she was screaming for someone to call the police she was screaming he was going to kill her, she kept crying Help me!. Doors were being slammed, stomping, sounded like stuff being thrown around and she was crying and pleading with him to stop. It was in the middle of the night, I woke my friend up and we both were in shock. Our phones wouldn't let us call the emergency line so I called my landlord and told him to call the police but they never came.

After hours of hearing her get brutally beat, the couple left on their motorbike and stayed gone for a couple days. When they returned, her head was bandaged and her face was black and blue.The guy called me and my friend out to talk because he wanted to ""clear the air"" because our landlord told him I had complained. 

My friend talked one on one with the guy and I talked privately with the girl. The story they told us was that we must have heard a movie they were watching and after the movie they went for a ride and she fell off the motorbike requiring stitches. 

The day after the beating, I tried filing a police report but was told they couldn't do anything unless the girl filed the complaint and the police never went to talk to her.

Although Bali is mostly Hindu, Indonesia still has the largest Muslim majority in the world. In Islam, people are taught that what's between the husband and wife is to be resolved by the husband and wife only, hence the very laid back, laughing it off reaction from the receptionist. It's not directly linked to the religion, it's more about the culture which is strongly influenced by religion.

Even if the police came, sometimes that makes it worse for the victims if the perpetrators are not taken away. Having the police called on them, really angers the perpetrators which makes them even more violent (see cases where men and women lost their lives after police intervention in DV). 

You've tried to do the right thing, kudos to you for that. You couldn't do anything else to fix the situation without putting yourselves in danger.

I was similar age, slightly older. We started chatting a lot, grabbing coffees. Smashed out some really good work as a team doing different activities. She asked me to help her with her car, she asked me to work on a weekend just so we could hang out. Lots of just random chats during the day.
It was confusing as I was getting mixed messages. Because sometimes it felt a little more, then around other people it was a little like I didn't exist.  And you know, the fear of the wrath of HR. Plus, I'm a weird dude and the whole place runs on rumors and reputations. There's no way I'd mess up someone's career like that.
You just keep it professional and friendly whilst using the brief extra dopamine to motivate you to do good work.
So anywho. . . .she started dating another dude, and the project wound up so I head back to my usual team. My career stagnated and hers took off. She became my direct supervisor and it was a bit like old times. In that we just operated super efficiently, both on the same page and able to understand things with minimal words or even just a sideways look. It's actually really refreshing working with people that just get stuff. It makes the work easier. But, yeah, only had to just remind myself that I was imagining things a few small times and it was fine.

Just small things, I'll bring you coffee, I'll compliment your outfit, I'll be kind even on my gloomy days etc.

If the circumstances don't let there be more, then I keep it at this.  
For example, I had a colleague at a former workplace with whom we became friends with - I was in a relationship, she was in a relationship, but the attraction from both sides was pulpable.  
So while obviously I was nicer to her than most other people, I knew while I am 100% loyal to my partner and she probably is too, my stupid brain will start inventing fantasies if I don't thread carefully. So I tried to minimize the chance of catching feelings by trying not to spend too much time with her alone, but since I was still attracted, obviously even on my grumpy days I was still nice to her when not so much with others.

Or I had a friend who always had the hottest girlfriends. Not the smartest, probably the craziest, but definitely the hottest. It didn't make life easy for me because I have a good way with words around women, those girls always liked me most from the group, so they were looking a lot for my company apart their boyfriend obviously when we were out. That's when I learned even when I wouldn't ever do anything like that, my brain will invent fantasies *anyway.*",2,2025-09-25,04:43:15

It's at the point where if I was dating someone, I think I would probably have a bit of performance anxiety.

I’m with a really wonderful man — he’s kind, caring, and we connect well in most ways. The one area we’ve struggled is in sex. From early on, we never quite hit our stride. For me, a big part of arousal is feeling my partner’s arousal, and I think he’s similar — which means sometimes we both end up waiting for the other to “get going.”

Over time, this has turned into a pattern: he seems to only be able to finish in very specific scenarios (from behind, or getting head), and recently he’s been struggling to get or stay hard at all. I don’t want to jump straight to labelling it “ED,” but I’m starting to wonder if that might be part of what’s happening. If we try anything face-to-face or different, he usually loses his erection.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of mismatch? How did you approach it in your relationship? What helped you (or your partner) work through it?

Not sure what the plan even is. As the question of what you want and research how to get there, then after you draw enough lines from dot to dot you now have a path to take and a plan on how to get there, each dot might represent a hurdle or milestone, some dots might take a year or more to get to, some you will never get to so you draw a new bypass dot which ends at the same place.

I was in my later twenties and had very similar depressive ideations about my future at a time I was in a lot of pain after college, doing really important work out in our community but still feeling like a failure from old family issues.  

I subconsciously pushed away / couldn’t believe my (now) wife’s, and several others interest that year because I was so anti-sure of myself.

It took going out to events & having fun again after re-connecting with an old friend to open up more with my wife, but she still had to ask me to hang out initially. I didn’t even ‘get it’ then until a motherly coworker from a different job put me on the spot about this cool chick I kept talking about hanging out and going to activities with.  

My point is this- there’s no guarantees in life but to even have the opportunities for a fulfilling future you have to be able to overcome many of your own comfort / risk barriers, whatever they might be.",2,2025-09-25,16:35:30

AskMen,No-Association-9316,1nq7wik,What was one thing your teen self wanted in a wife?,168,0,50,wruthinkng,ng54jyh,"It wasn’t one thing. I (61M) remember being about 14 listening to the Beatles, reading a lot and observing my friends parents and my own, and thinking that I wanted a woman who wanted to have kids, who was very intelligent herself, had her own interests and career (whatever it might be), was kind to other people, was sensible and didn’t smoke. Not in that order. I just thought about the kind of woman I wanted as a life partner. I was never interested in casual sex or one night stands even before I had a girlfriend and that has not changed since I had my first girlfriend. 

I realized that to get a woman like I dreamed of I had to become the kind of man that a woman would want to have as her husband for a long term relationship and have kids with, so I had to be careful in the choices I make and how I act around other people. I had to work on myself first. 

I also REALLY wanted to have a girlfriend/wife that I found very attractive and who would love me for who I am, be enthusiastic and playful in the bedroom and would this would hopefully last our lifetimes through all the physical changes and challenges that life brings. 

Hanging out with my friends and talking to girls at that age made me afraid that I had unrealistic goals, I’d get cheated on and ignored/disrespected despite my best efforts. I expected to be disappointed and have to settle for less than my dreams. But I was going to give it my best shot. 

I met my love at university when I was 19 and she was 18. She was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful girls on campus. She was, and still is, a stunning redhead. Lots of guys were after her but to my profound surprise she took a liking to me.

AskMen,No-Association-9316,1nq7wik,What was one thing your teen self wanted in a wife?,168,0,50,serene_brutality,ng5lrw3,"I honestly didn’t think much about it. I was pretty naive and trusting, thinking that most people are generally good. I just wanted her to be kinda pretty, nice and get along well, obviously loyal. Turns out that’s a lot harder to find than I expected. 

Loyalty is actually a lot more rare than I ever imagined. And people are baskets of trauma and insecurities that absentmindedly take it out on their partners with depressing regularity. If the trauma didn’t come their upbringing it comes from naively trusting or loving someone they shouldn’t have. Then getting in relationships with someone hoping they’ll be mindful of their personal traumas, frequently not paying the same mindfulness. 

In my teens, being shy lacking confidence due to lots of bullying, I was never very popular with the ladies. A few girls were interested in retrospect but I missed it. So my standards disappeared and I got with the first woman who’d give me a chance, and that’s my villain origin story lol. After her I went a little wild, fumbled some good women, played with a lot of bad. Eventually got to a point where I thought I was ok and could find love again. I was wrong. Still not quite healed enough to marry again, and on top of that I didn’t marry someone who was able to with my bs, not that she should have had to, but a better woman could have helped me as I was trying to work through it. Adding fuel to the fire she had her own bs that even if I wasn’t still broken she went and did the thing that no husband can tolerate. She did it to her second husband and I’ve seen her try to do it with her third, so it wasn’t just me that caused her to do it.

So after two failed marriages and broken homes and painful divorces, 3 children that didn’t get their dad the way they should have, I swore off marriage and got a vasectomy. I’ve had a few girlfriends since, one lasted a long time and was great until it wasn’t, solidifying my anti marriage (for me) stance.

I’m still naive, hopeful I’ll find a lasting love one day. But I’m pretty sure I’m dying alone. I’m 43 traumatized, though I’m really good about not letting it affect my behavior in a relationship, though not perfect, untrusting, and suspicious. A little too vigilant about noticing unfaithful behavior, extremely sensitive to it. It not hard to appear faithful, trustworthy but man if people just refuse to do so. Just don’t be dishonest, keep your promises and don’t behave like cheaters behave. And if you act questionably don’t fly off the handle when I ask questions, or say I’m having certain feelings. Feelings aren’t accusations, they’re just feelings and I should be able to share them with you without you getting defensive. 

The women in my age group aren’t much different but from my experience they don’t bother to reign in their traumas or insecurities. Rare is it to find someone who actually does the work to try to heal, or willing to work with someone while they do. Most people just go from relationship to relationship without healing accumulating traumas, thinking they just need to “find the right guy” or gal who “will love me for me, no matter what.” Yet they aren’t willing to love someone “no matter what” themselves.",1,2025-09-25,13:46:23

“Giving up what you love?”


Pffffffffff.


You know who complains about that shit? People who are into serial monogamy.

That is the type of shit people say to convince themselves (or others) that it’s okay to end the relationship, or to fuck someone they just met at the bar.

“After all, why not? I mean, I’ve really lost myself! I gave up what I loved!”


And, no. Nobody is going to “love you for who you are.” In fact, most of us aren’t “who we are” when we are dating: are the best presentation of ourselves we can muster for the sake of being interesting/getting laid.

And here is the “compromise” many will fail to acknowledge: when you are in a lifelong relationship, every decision you make affects at least 2 lives.

What I met was a woman who was committed to working on her mental health challenges from a traumatic childhood.

We have stayed together because we are both committed to healing. We don't always get it right, but we are working on it. Shit is sometimes messy.

The problem with the belief in ""soul mate"" is that it will then come as a surprise when they are shit heads. ""he's my soul mate, how could he eat all the pretzels and leave the empty bag in the fridge?""",103,2025-09-25,03:14:42

Then…I met her. I know she’s my soulmate because my life feels completely empty without her. The days are longer when she’s not around, and the nights she’s gone are the worst nights of my life. I count down the minutes until we’re both home again. She makes me feel safe, heard, and comfortable 100% of the time. Shes truly my best friend in every sense of the phrase. 

Everything we do is an adventure and something I look forward to. Going to the grocery store? Heck yeah! Let’s go giggle as we knock on watermelons. Gotta go to the doctors? That’s cool, let’s go together and hit the local Zoo on the way home just for fun. Let’s walk to the mailbox? It’s a chance to hold hands and reflect on our day.

I can spend an entire week straight, literally 24/7, in her presence, with only me and her, and we won't get sick or bored of each other. We won't argue or start giving each other attitude. Nothing is difficult when we're together. We never make each other's days worse. We never take each other for granted, and we always try to reciprocate each other's efforts.

I know I'm with the right person because I am flawed, and she still accepts me completely and unconditionally. I often try to spoil her as much as I am able, but on a few occasions, I've been at home feeling tired and unmotivated, sleeping away half the day and not doing anything productive for the other half, while my girlfriend spent 12 hours at work, and I just haven't had the energy and motivation to clean the house beyond the bare minimum or have a fancy dinner prepared for her when she gets home.

I feel really guilty on those days because I want to be better for her, but it never puts a strain on the relationship. She comes home, tired after work, but she's happy to see **ME**. Not the things I've done for **her**. And that 100% makes it worth the times I do spoil her. It's never conditional. And she knows it goes both ways. We are both allowed our bad days, and our bad days never mean we stop loving each other.

On those bad days, she'll still tell me about her day at work, we'll order some food or I make us something simple to eat, we'll catch an episode of whatever show we're watching at the time, we'll go to bed together, and we'll watch instagram reels together until she falls asleep on my chest. It doesn't matter how the day went. We'll always end the day on good terms. We're in a relationship for each other because we're best friends, not for what we get out of it.

To know you're with the right person, learn to tell when you love someone as a person, (personality, common interests, sense of humor, deep connection, interesting conversations, etc.) or if you just love the benefits you get from them (intimacy, money, gifts, favors, bragging rights, etc).

There's conflicting claims about it.  Some say it's gone way down as the internet and technology become part of everyone's lives to the extent social interaction and going out of any kind has plummeted.  Others claim that at least with strength and fitness the internet and technology has had the opposite effect.  And that the rise of influencers in bodybuilding, powerlifting, strongman and general heavy lifting has led to increased desire to emulate them.

So how has interest and passion for strength and fitness in men, particularly heavy lifting and getting the biggest physiques possible, changed in the last decade?  Particularly for me aged 20 to 50 if possible.

My sense is that focusing on strength and fitness have diminished insofar that in the past, it was essentially a default setting that young men focus on being in shape as a part of ""masculinity."" Today, we don't stress that stereotype of masculinity as much.

On the other hand, fitness and strength training have become hobbies and lifestyles. It's not as tied to masculinity now as they are increasingly popular with women.

Now we're eight years strong. This of course is going to be super situational to my relationship, but here's what changed.

I learned it's not just what I say, but how I say it that can change the outcome of a conversation. I'm very logical, she's very emotional(and admittedly a lil dramatic). So if she suggests something that isn't the best and I say, ""thats dumb"" her brain registers that as ""you're dumb"".

She's a very clingy extrovert who wants to show off her man to her friends and family. I'm an introvert who can be reclusive and antisocial at times. We learned to find a balance. A date night every month, I show up on every major holiday and do my best to socialize even if I have to put on a metaphorical mask. 

Her love languages words of affirmation and physical touch. If she looks good, I don't just think it, I say it to her. I kiss her every single morning before I leave for work. I hug her when I get home.

My mom decided to unilaterally stop having sex with my dad.  For two years he approached her to try and talk it out.  Her answer multiple times was “if you want to have sex, go find someone else to have sex with.”  Eventually he did just that.

When my mom found out, she blew up everything.  She was SO mad.  And then she realized through consulting with the divorce attorney that she would lose the lifestyle she loved when they split things 50/50.  She wanted the vacation home and the main home and the trips they took but realized she would never be able to do that with just half the stuff.  So she took him back.

What she did after that broke my dad.  He was a beaten man both physically and emotionally.  His depression was so severe he lost the will to stand up for himself.  Dementia soon followed.  His last years were a living hell.  Anything that went wrong was his fault, even when he was so bad he didn’t recognize me.  Once she realized what was going on she started to feel guilty, which was the worse thing that could happen as she refused to put him in a home where he could get proper care and get away from her.

Honestly it was a relief when he finally died, an empty shell of the vibrant man I knew growing up.

But she was going to move out about five years ago, had a place in mind and put a first and last month’s rent down payment down, only to find out it was a scam and she lost $4,000.

Usually, I would be that asshole and say what the fuck were you thinking, and technically, did want to say it. But, I did become a voice of reason when she felt stupid, and said this wouldn’t have happened if I had not been such an asshole and said fuck it, leave then, when she wanted me to listen to her prior to all this happening.

We have been married 25 years, but if I had to say, the last five have been the best in terms of me finding myself, etc. … We went to marriage counseling, we had done it before, but we finally found the right person. It led me down the path of self-discovery of what I acted the way I did, always trying to find confrontation in the smallest things to learn that is how my relationship was with my mom and I, and I was never able to cope with that, and this was shortly after my mother had died too. Also, add I was an only child to a single parent because my parents got divorced when I was young.

But therapy was the best thing ever, and I started going on my own that opened up so much more that once I stopped going about a year and a half ago, I have never really looked back in how I was because I have the mechanisms to work through my problems that I never had before because I basically grew up in a toxic, always fight environment and then everyone acted like it never happened two minutes later, whereas my wife wore that shit like a battle wound over and over until she became worn out.

In the end, nothing is a stupid idea, the question is do you have a solid plan to rectify what the root problem is without things like therapy or better yet, a therapist who really knows what they are doing to unlock all that shit we hold inside and carry and make our relationships suffer in adulthood.

Some other old injuries seem to have gone away.  Like my shins, which have had multiple fractures during my dancer years and hurt throughout my twenties.  Also my torn rotator cuff in my shoulder that was caused by a ballerina leaning forward suddenly in what’s called a torch lift.  I thought that shoulder would always hurt, but that’s gone.

I immediately went back to sleep.

His name was “Bunny”; one of my first words was “Bunny” because me and that rabbit were inseparable from that point on. I couldn’t sleep without him until an embarrassingly late age. I consider him the most sentimental item I own, and everywhere I have travelled, he has come with me.

My entry hall is lined with completed puzzles my mom and grandma did in the last years of grandma's life. They're nice puzzles, usually artworks.

I have a tapestry of a fishing village on my wall, because I liked it. There's a floor to ceiling bookshelf along another wall, divided into thirds. Left and right are books I've read. Middle is memories.

Top is oldest. Family photos as a kid, my old Wren junk sculpture I made in 7th grade that my mom had sealed in an acrylic box. As you work your way down, you'll see newer stuff, my kids' baby portraits, the paw print of my best bud, and clay models.

By the time you're at waist level, you see the recent stuff. Pics of the kids now, and of course, the grand babies. Next to my key dish is a rearing tiger figure my youngest got me a couple years back.

And up on high shelves, near the ceiling are my collectible/odd books. I have a complete set of *Harry Potter*, 1st editions, with UK art that catches the eye, for instance. Or *The Secret Language of Birthdays* 😅

One for vending machines that have a secret code I've programmed so they'll dispense one snack per entry. 

I would probably class that one as a not-for-profit, as I would like it to be relatively low maintenance. (No grant writing needed if the charity paid for itself.)

The second is for getting wheelchairs to people whose insurers will not provide for. Probably call that one a charity and crowdfund it. 

Tbh the vending idea is good enough that it might make sense to call a charity. Lots of improvements I could make, too, like a second cash acceptor for the well-meaning and of course virtualization of the whole thing so others can follow suit. 

I just feel like we should help out our neighbors tbh, and like the problems that come from outsourcing our good deeds are top of mind right now, so I'd like to get that done.

I've been at my job for a long time, and I've always recognized that ""keeping the peace"" is always the best policy when to comes to tension with other coworkers. You'll still be on good terms, plus you won't lost $$$ being fired.

The problem is that I hate my job and the people I work with. I also have a very crude/aggressive side that my coworkers have bever seen (very conservative and nerdy) I've always made it a point never show it for the reasons above. Don't want to stir the pot. Make coworkers uncomfortable. 

The problem is that I sort of snapped my last shift and showed a bit of my badass side...the worst part is that I sort of got off on it. I kinda want to do it again. But to counter that, I don't want a meeting with HR--but most of all--don't want to get fired. I have no back up plan as far as income goes. 

So what do I di? The door has already been opened. I sort of like brazenly scaring some of the dicks I work with. So what do I do?

As in, you're going out on dates in the hope of marrying the girl and it turns out she has diabetes. 


Hello everyone, I hope this message comes across respectfully. My intention is not to be negative in any way, and I sincerely apologize if this topic is sensitive for anyone.

I have been living with Type 1 diabetes since childhood, and while I strive to manage it as best as possible, even with good control there are inevitably days of highs and lows. As many of you know, diabetes does carry some risk of complications, though these risks can be significantly minimized with proper care and attention to health.

My question is more general and comes from curiosity. When men consider a potential partner, do they take this into account? Would the fact that she has diabetes influence their decision or possibly discourage them from pursuing marriage?

I am asking sincerely and would really appreciate hones not polished answers. I know that personally, there are certain health conditions I might find very difficult to cope with, and that could affect my own decision about marriage. I completely understand that others may feel the same which is why I’d like to hear genuine perspectives even if they are not easy to share.

AskMen,Sudden_Cheetah_7152,1nqkay4,What was your biggest struggle in life? I’m sharing mine below.,13,0,5,AutoModerator,ng7g6q7,"Here's an original copy of /u/Sudden_Cheetah_7152's post (if available):

I, a 35-year-old (current age) male, was diagnosed with a chronic lung disease at the end of 2020. Overnight, my life changed. I was suddenly put on a treatment plan that included more than ten medicines every single day. I kept hoping things would get better, but even after a year on such heavy doses, my health wasn’t improving. My doctor then suggested a drug test to check whether the medicines were actually working.

To my shock, the results showed that the infection in my lung was resistant to some of the medicines I had been taking. In simple words, all those medicines I had been relying on weren’t even fighting the bacteria that was slowly destroying my lung.

After that, I was moved to a second line of treatment with stronger medicines than before, but with even harsher side effects. It was exhausting, both physically and mentally.

By 2023, my condition had worsened so much that the only option left was to remove the infected lung. It was a terrifying decision because this kind of surgery carries high risks. But I didn’t have a choice. Thankfully, my doctor referred me to a brilliant and highly experienced surgeon, and I placed all my trust in him.

On 28/10/2023, I was on the operating table. As soon as the surgery began, I started bleeding heavily. The surgeon almost had to stop midway, stitch me up, and send me back to the ICU to attempt the surgery another day. But by God’s grace, the bleeding stopped just in time, and he continued. It was a complicated, life-threatening operation, but somehow, I made it through. The infected lung was removed, and I now live with just one lung.

I thought the worst was behind me. But soon after the surgery, I started noticing hearing problems. At first it was small things, but then my hearing rapidly declined until one day I realized I was almost completely deaf. When we saw an ENT specialist, I was given the heartbreaking news, the high-dose medicines I had been on had damaged my hearing permanently. The only way to hear again was through cochlear implant surgery.

For a middle-class family like mine, the cost of the surgery felt impossible. But with the support of an NGO, along with help from family and friends, we managed. I went through with the cochlear implant, and though it helps, my hearing still isn’t very clear. It feels more like having something rather than nothing.

Now, at just 35 years old, I find myself living with one lung, almost deaf without hearing aids, jobless, and with no social life. Marriage looks impossible. My longtime girlfriend broke up with me during those tough times, and many friends stopped contacting me since I could no longer join their activities or be part of their circle. At times, the future feels very dark, as if the problems will never end. Yet, I try to hold on to small moments of strength and hope that things can slowly get better.

Consider yourself lucky if you have not gone through the hell I have been and am still going through.

If you have gone through similar hardships, please share your struggle. Also, don’t forget to mention how you came out of that dark phase and how you are doing now.

I don't know what to say for your own situation since I haven't been there, other to say that you still DO have a future and you never know what it will bring.

I’m 36 and have noticed that dating feels different than it used to — it seems like men don’t court or put in as much effort anymore. I’m also deaf, and while I make sure to order food on my own and stay on top of communication so it doesn’t feel like extra work for anyone, sometimes I wonder if my deafness affects how men approach dating with me, or if it’s just something that changes with age.

For men in this sub — do you feel like the effort you put into dating has shifted over time? If so, what made it change for you personally?

First the gender ratio we have to deal with. Women have a ton of choices and attention, which means we get little to no response or effort. Even if we do, it becomes a game of how to grab 'her' attention being amongst 5 or 10 guys she is talking to. 

If some how we get to a date... then comes the planning, paying for dates (appaling number of women have a sense of entitlement the guy should pay) , being the person carrying the conversation, plan the next date (if at all it happens). It becomes a chore, tiring and seriously makes us question why we are doing it in the first place. ROI is in the gutter.

I 💯 agree women have problems too in dating. It's a.problem of choice and filtering. Im not invalidating those at all. But when it comes to choices in dating, women play god mode and men are playing with scraps. Its a zero sum game. If you ask any guy, they'd have the problem of too many v barely anything.

But that's because I noticed i wasn't getting any efforts back. If I'm putting in 100, and the other is putting in 0, but saying they're putting in 100, I'm going to stop putting anything in after that. That's modern dating for men. When I was married, she put in 10%, if put in everything I had. When I completely exhausted myself, she turned against me really harshly. So, I had to learn. If I allowed my SO to give little to nothing, it isn't expected to get better. So, it's better to match. I'll give at first, then if it isn't returned, I say something. If that is met with dismissal, or with manipulation tactics, then i leave. Simple as that. It sucks too, when modem women say men putting in 100% from the start, with them putting in 0 is the bare minimum expectation from men. Yeah bump that. 

The other point I'll point out. It doesn't have anything to do with you being deaf. There are many men out there that have switched, from being the givers, to being the takers. There are many other men that have always been the takers. 
There are men that are tired from being the givers, and are on the brink to being takers. 

The point here is, not all men out there are the same. But, it's just as OK of a standard, for you to expect return from your efforts. The key is for both to give back. And to not expect the whole world, especially from the very start, like most modern women do these days. 

Personally, I just know that you being deaf has nothing to do with it. I'd give a woman a chance regardless. The key there would be to make sure we started chill, and worked our way up to expecting from each other. Mutual effort, and reasonable expectations.

AskMen,ineedcoffeeasap,1nqo0j2,Men in their 30s+: How has the effort you put into dating changed over time?,38,0,2,Valuable_sandwich44,ng8kptg,"Well, looking back from my experience; I'd say that up to the age of 30 a guy is more excited and attracted to young females in the dating pool - plus he still has that romanticised view of love.

From age 15 to 30 life is about having fun and falling in and out of love.

As you grow older, you start to realise how shitty life can be and how no one gives a fk if you live or die or live out of a dumpster. 

At that point, you also realise that you're better off in your comfort zone and it's not worth taking risks wasting time, energy and money on someone else.

If a woman likes what she sees; they should step forward in any way they see fit.

Past 30 or 35 is also an age when a man should be making good money and perhaps own their house or start a mortgage.

At that point, a guy doesn't really have much time or energy left to date; and his priorities become a) enjoying life and b) retirement plan.

Guys also have an extra option that maybe a few women have too; travel to a developing country and marry a 20+ year old girl that will take care of him and the house in exchange for some pocket money, living abroad and maybe transfer $100 each month to her parents.",1,2025-09-25,23:18:48

AskMen,xRaginCajunx,1nqldx7,What trade recommendations do yall have for someone looking to get themselves together?,20,0,4,AutoModerator,ng7nukw,"Here's an original copy of /u/xRaginCajunx's post (if available):

So I’m 20. A little bit of background, I’ve grown up as someone who in high school was smart, very musically talented, and was amazing with numbers. However I have some pretty poor characteristics, I’m addicted to video games, have a horrible diet, have zero hands on experience whatsoever, and absolutely hated school.

I was told before I know it I would have to do something and here I am in the blink of an eye 20 with nothing to do. I tried to start my own business reselling golf clubs and only got to about 2k profit/month. Im grateful that I’m still able to live at home, however, I would really like to get my shit together and become independent. 

So I guess I wanted to ask given the short background, have any of you been in the same boat or known someone who has? My friends around me that I play games and went to high school with are all starting to find their things and I’ve been stuck here job hopping minimum wage jobs (fast food, car wash, worked in EMS for a few months). 

I just really need a skill to learn and I’ve been considering trade school for awhile now, any trade or even life recommendations would be great,

thanks.

They work off of a pass/fail system, if you show up and do the work you're passing (getting a B).  While standing in line to get into his dorm on move in day, numerous people offered him a job.

He's been given a full ride scholarship to the trade school in exchange for 3 years of work at one of the best employers in the state (large energy company) supporting their fleet operations.  Good pay, good working conditions, good benefits, and most employees are there for life because it's such a good job.  The entrance criteria is very low - my son was a mediocre student in HS, but it didn't matter.  This particular energy company provides these scholarships to around 20 people each year for things like controls technology, IT technology, mechanics, etc.  When we toured the campus we talked a bit to one of the instructors and he kind of laughed that no one is paying full tuitions, there's tons of financial aid out there.

AskMen,xRaginCajunx,1nqldx7,What trade recommendations do yall have for someone looking to get themselves together?,20,0,4,ProbablyLongComment,ng7swtj,"In the US, certain trades (electric, plumbing, etc.) will hire you with no experience, and will train you on the job.  As you progress, you will be eligible for higher license levels.  Employers typically provide all the materials and cover the fees for these, since they can charge more for your services if you have a higher license.

In Texas, a journeyman electrician makes about as much as the average Bachelor's Degree holder, without working overtime.  With overtime, your earning potential is obviously much greater.  A journeyman license takes about 4 years to get, roughly the same as a Bachelor's, except that you are paid to learn for those 4 years, instead of paying someone else for the privilege.

If none of the trades sound appealing to you, consider joining the military.  The pay isn't quite as good as the trades, but since your housing, food, and utilities are paid for, it hardly matters.  Plus, the benefits are the best you'll ever find.

The military is your shortest path to independence, but it's not for everyone.  If you look at joining, choose a job with good civilian options, not the job that sounds the coolest.  For example, being a tank gunner seems cool, but after you get out, you'll be right back working at a car wash or whatever.  Instead, consider a job in medical or IT.",2,2025-09-25,20:32:33

AskMen,AntAffectionate5706,1nqjsh9,How do you get past intrusive thoughts about an ex?,18,0,1,AutoModerator,ng7cjsx,"Here's an original copy of /u/AntAffectionate5706's post (if available):

Hey dudes. 24 M here who screwed up his last relationship (24F) in the most typical and disappointing ways, with a few extra awful wrenches thrown in the spokes. 

Trying to do a lot of self work to avoid hurting someone the way I hurt her, and I’ve spent a few months doing church confessions, group addiction type therapy and stuff along those lines. The usual stuff I guess for someone like me after hitting bottom. 

Now I’m in this boat: she seems to want nothing to do with me ever again, for good reason, and I just cannot get her out of my mind at all. I left home young and have had a lot of serious girlfriends. None imprinted as hard on my psyche. I know I am not the first guy in history to act stupid and get dumped, but I have that heavy, almost juvenile feeling that I lost the forever one, and this totally teenage emotion meter that goes haywire at the slightest hint of her. A song I listened to while knowing her, even one she never commented on or liked, for example, comes up in the car and I just lose it. Weirdly (and uncharacteristically for me), it’s not a reaction I really externalize. It’s this dull heaviness in my chest, this loss of willpower, and a really strong urge to reach out. Almost like I’m drowning or something. 

Have been leaning hard into my work, health habits, time with family, exploring our cultural history and reading more than usual. Trying new things all the time. But nothing is shaking this emptiness for long. Everything I do has a damper on it. 

I am not the jubilant person I was. Though I recognize my screw ups in the relationship should rationally cause me guilt and the loss should feel like loss, I don’t think that’s what I’m experiencing anymore. I just plainly miss my best friend. 

Trying to be social now with people in my age bracket… to meet friends… feels so bleh.  I went 21 years without meeting someone I could really stand being around. And she loved me too.  

I’m sure a lot of y’all have had similar experiences. Any advice? I know I can’t make myself get over her, and I don’t want to. But I need some kind of method by which to compartmentalize, at least during working hours. As it stands I’m like a horse that can run alright but I keep catching stray arrows. How do I make my brain dodge better? 

Do I just need to wait and maybe in a year it lessens by itself? Dumbest thing about all of this is the thought of getting over her truly scares me more than almost any other option. It’s like I want to keep the void because then I still have some part of the love. Dammit!!

While I did not graduate and that year was mostly a waste of time and money, Murray State University was only 1501.00 a semester including dorm fees, tuition, and meal ticket to eat in the cafeteria, so not much money and I did have fun, joined a fraternity and made lifelong friends that I am still in touch with to this day.",1,2025-09-25,10:32:18
AskMen,Bunniesxoxo,1nq37k1,What age did you graduate university?,33,0,0,BlackAsphaltRider,ng4kfcx,"Sad story coming your way. 

I was far beyond my years as a young kid. Blew the competition away. I was spelling words like “dictionary” in kindergarten when others were still trying to spell their name. I was also a year younger (started at 4). I was so much further along they wanted me to skip a grade on top of that. My parents said no because I was already young. I would’ve started high school at 12. 

As it was, I started college at 17 and should’ve graduated at 21. In high school I didn’t study for anything. Got A’s in my sleep without trying. Crushed the SATs like it was a spelling bee. Gave the Valedictorian a run for their money but didn’t care enough to be top dog. Got a full scholarship for school anyway. 4 years paid. 

First semester of college, continued to crush it. Thought it was going to be 4 years of easy street. 

Second semester? Met who would become a lifelong friend. Met women. Had all the experiences I didn’t have in high school. Failed that semester miserably. Had to pay back the scholarship money before I could go back. I grew up poor, didn’t have the money. Slung pizza at the Hut for a year to pay it back. 

Started school again, changed my major a thousand times. Took 4 years to get an associates (22), took another 8 to get a useless bachelors (30) and working on a second useful bachelors (35). Make under 60k a year. All because I was “too smart” to make up my mind on what I wanted in life and too dumb to make up the difference with consistency.

It wasn't until I happened to recount the stories to my ex when she said ""Yeah, you know they sexually assaulted you, right?  You're a victim.""  Even then, it didn't really sink in for me really.

* Dior Sauvage – clean, versatile, universally attractive.
* Bleu de Chanel – classy, safe, works in any setting.
* Tom Ford Noir Extreme – warmer, spicier, more seductive for nights.
* YSL La Nuit de L’Homme – smooth, refined, has that magnetic pull.

End of the day, pick one and wear it with confidence. The scent doesn’t seal the deal your presence does. The fragrance just amplifies it.

Only criteria is it should be fun and bonus points if my friends question in if I’m nuts or if they should join in.

Disclaimer: repost because of a stupid translation mistake in the previous post that felt too late to fix, I’m sorry 🥲

So, I'm 22 years old and not very sexually experienced. But based on the limited experience I have, I fear I might be among the 1-3% of the male population who can't have normal intercourse without ejaculating almost immediately (lifelong PE).

To better understand my body and what to expect, I'd like to have a few comparisons:

-What was the shortest time you've lasted in bed?

-If you try to jerk off as quickly as possible (in the shower or something), what's the minimum time it takes?

-If you last a reasonable amount of time during sex, do you get close quickly but can you hold it, or does it take a reasonable amount of time to even get close?

-How much is your stamina affected by situational factors? Has it generally improved with age and experience?

-Is it much easier to control yourself while masturbating than during sex, or is it similar?

Thanks!

Let's answer some for our anxious friend here.

Shortest time, probably 3 minutes. Then round 2, shit happens. 

As quick as possible, damn I don't know probably 5 minutes. 

It's not easy once you get close, switch positions if we're not in rhythm. Does it take a reasonable level of time to get there for me yes but situational.

How much is stamina affected by situational factors, massively. 

Has it improved with age and experience, yeah.

Is it easier to control yourself alone, yes, massively.


You my friend might psyche yourself out so much you find it hard to bust at all which has happened to me, if you're stressing it can become impossible. 

You might bust early, so what, give her ample foreplay and if you do bust early keep her warm whilst you reload, I doubt you bust early twice in a row and if you think it's that bad jerk off before you link up.

And to be honest I don't think its actually a deal breaker for most women. Penetration is just one part of many in sex. I mean for some people its not part of sex at all, if you think about it. Just use your hands and mouth, and get back in there once you're ready.",4,2025-09-25,20:14:11

My first time having sex I climaxed almost immediately after getting it in. 

> -If you try to jerk off as quickly as possible (in the shower or something), what's the minimum time it takes? 

If I'm really turned on and go straight for the finish line I probably do it in under a minute. 

> If you last a reasonable amount of time during sex, do you get close quickly but can you hold it, or does it take a reasonable amount of time to even get close? 

This is something that I've worked on for decades and has a lot to do with comfort levels and my partner. I used to get close quickly and I learned to ""cool off"" so I could last longer. But that had the drawback of also cooling her off. I could switch to oral on her while I cool off but just the act of switching cooled her off and she described it as ""starting from scratch."" Part of that is vaginal vs. clitoral stimulation. She has to take one path or the other to orgasm. Switching means starting over. 

Over the years I got better at pacing so I didn't need any cool off breaks. Now I finally have more direct control over how long I last if I can find a good groove or pace. When I am ready to go for it I pick up the pace, which really does it for her also and we can often climax together. 

> -How much is your stamina affected by situational factors?

FIrst of all, I don't like this word ""stamina."" That's not really what's going on. It's not like I ejaculate because I'm exhausted. I have the physical stamina to go for quite some time if I'm not going wild with the thrusting or holding some awkward position. It's just that all desire for sex leaves my body almost immediately after ejaculation. I could physical keep going if my erection didn't disappear.

That said, my ability to pace myself is affected by situational factors. BUt even that is lessened with experience and age. Changing partners would likely set me back. A lot of my technique is built around my current partner's preferences and quirks. Also, my comfort levels would be lower with a new partner. I would be much more anxious with a new partner. 

> -Is it much easier to control yourself while masturbating than during sex, or is it similar? 

That's a very good question. I generally don't try to control myself when masturbating so I dont' really know. I don't have much incentive to control it by myself because I'm not trying to ensure that anyone else is satisfied. Also, vagina is something I want to savor.

If you're into sports betting then you need insider knowledge that the bookmakers don't have, and that sort of information is kept to a very small group of individuals who's employment ususally depends on them never sharing that information beyond that small group (team doctors, for example, would know before the bookmakers if the team's star player is injured for the next big game).

Although it's legal to count cards because it's not cheating, the casinos will expell anyone they *suspect* of counting cards and then you'll find it difficult to use your hard-earned skills in many other casinos elsewhere.

If you're into illegal gambling then I don't think I need to discuss that much - it's illegal, it's probably better to bet on being either caught by the authorities or shot by rival gangs one day before you can retire with your ill-gotten gains.

Trading? I'm not an expert but whenever you see someone who has made a fortune in trading remember that behind them are thousands of other individuals who are financially ruined because of it. There's a massive influence of Survivor Bias in our knowledge of individuals who make money in trading - the ones who fail due to bad luck, lose everything and lose their jobs don't get into the media, whereas the ones who make lots of money might not realise how much their fortune was influenced by just being lucky. I'm not saying there's no skill or intelligence involved, but just being very very clever isn't enough and definitely isn't a guarantee of future success.",1,2025-09-25,04:54:55

Hey guys, i was just thinking if id still enjoy and play a lot of games at 60+ years old. Or would my mind get fatigued really quickly due to the high intensity.. Im thinking if id still enjoy and play competitive games. Will my skill reduce drastically and would my reactions reduce to the point where it wont be fun playing? Just curious

That might not mean they stop playing competitive games, but they have a sweaty period and a more chill period, maybe they try being sweaty again or in a different game, or they just do as you've mentioned, moving into less stressful more experience games.

A lot of it comes down to the types of games. People can only keep up for so long in something like Starcraft, where it requires an insane amount of cognition, awareness, and almost perfect twitch skill at a high level. Similar to a degree with shooters, you can be competitive, but at a certain point you're not going to be efficiently able to keep up with others. But if you play games that are more about tactics and less about speed or twitch, you can keep playing those for a long time. Even faster paced games you can stay competitive with, provided they're more about consistent movement, or patterns, rather than immediate reactions.

I think Fortnite has been that realization for a lot of the Millennial FPS players, where they can't exclusively rely on their trained abilities over time. So they go into build modes, and get decimated by kids who have been born into that system, and learnt how to make an entire castle relying entirely on twitch, and extreme precision beyond the traditional FPS level.",1,2025-09-25,14:29:13

So don't come there with a completely friendly trajectory while masquerading and hiding the fact that you actually are attracted to them let it be known that you're attracted to them just do so when their signs are obvious that the feelings are mutual.",0,2025-09-25,03:03:01

Hello guys, I have been noticing something in a lot of series and TV dramas. How characters are willing to sacrifice everything for someone they barely know. For example…. in Squid game,the main character gives up his life for the baby, and just now while watching Alice in Borderland, I saw the same kind of situation. ( sacrifice for friends is kinda theme of this series )

It honestly makes me feel bad, because when I imagine myself in that position, I don’t think I could make that kind of sacrifice. It makes me feel selfish. I feel like a monster, as if i dont care about the feelings of others. Its not that i am a robot or something. I really do care about others but i wont be willing to sacrifice my life for anyone i barely know.  Has anyone else felt the same way? Would love to know about thoughts,

Now some people feel they have nothing left to live for anyways and may be more willing to sacrifice themselves, but that’s a whole other psychological conversation. Most people’s survival instinct makes it very hard for them to knowingly give up their life. There’s gotta be a very strong motivator at play to overcome that.",2,2025-09-25,17:23:28

I was watching an Instagram video in which people were asked if they’d date someone overweight. Most men said no (I need this and that, I can’t date an overweight girl), while most women said yes (I don’t mind; it’s about his heart, not his looks).

I personally agree that having a healthy lifestyle matters more than just labeling someone as overweight. But it made me curious
From a man’s perspective, what actually counts as overweight to you?
If a woman ticks every box you’re looking for in terms of personality, values, and compatibility, but she’s overweight, would you still date her?
How much weight do you put on appearance vs. personality when it comes to choosing a partner?

That being stated, most dudes when they say overweight they mean like obese a.k.a. visibly overweight. A thicker girl would be overweight by medical standards but most dudes will give that girl a chance unless they're from a culture that praises absolute skinniness (think like many East Asian countries -- not all of them though).

I love bigger women so naturally I'd give them a chance (if I wasn't married). But even I have my limits as there comes a point where no matter how good a woman is, I could not look past how big she'd be. I don't put appearance as much up there compared to other things like personality because I've met plenty of beautiful yet vapid or basic women.

I choose personality and whether or not they're into me. Tall or short, big or skinny, as long as she's a woman and into me I'd be willing to give them a chance.

My bigger issue is the relationship they have with their weight: speaking as someone who's carrying around a whole extra person worth of weight, I have incredible insecurity and body issues about it and it's fucked with my mental health, and that's a major reason why I'm not going to date.

First of all, don't get your polling info from IG videos.

Second, it's bullshit because most women in the US are overweight and that number only goes up as women get older. Those men won't hold out for long and will settle for an overweight woman eventually. The numbers just don't work out otherwise. Men like to talk a big game about what they find attractive but in reality we almost always trade looks for good personality. It's the opposite of women who tend to talk a big game about personality but in reality looks play a bigger role than they will admit. 

Third, I think what they mean is OBESE. Obesity in the US is so normalized that overweight is just ""thick"" now. Medically obese is actually a lot lower BMI than most people realize. 

> while most women said yes (I don’t mind; it’s about his heart, not his looks). 

That's also bullshit for different reasons. Women unconsciously  project personality trait onto men based on their looks. So they might THINK they're interested in his personality/heart, their perception his personality/heart is very much influenced by his looks whether they realize it or not. His weight, his height, his sense of style... all superficial ""looks"" that have little to do with personality or heart.

This bias also affects men's confidence. A good looking man is just more likely to be confident. The not good looking man gets less attention from women because of his looks, which hurts his confidence, which in turn makes him less attractive. It's a nasty negative feedback loop.",1,2025-09-25,18:17:37

The 2-5 minutes you se is condensed down from several hours of shooting and the focus is going to be wherever the producers want it to be. I've seen The polar opposite of the video you described where it's women being shallow about looks/money and men talking about wanting a companion who is kind.

That being said, looks matter. Most good qualities are not so unique that they win in a vacuum. You can be smart kind, funny, and helpful. But chances are that there is someone else who has comparable qualities who might be in better shape. Most people aren't checking for perfection, but you will have a limited pool if you're significantly heavier than average.

What’s horrible is what they do when they have to do a tissue sample or insert/take out an IUD. Doing that they’re gonna have to clamp your insides(aka cervix) down to keep it in place- the clamp has spikes ! And for the tissue sample they clamp/cut out a clump of you and lets the open wound bleed. Both of those hurt like hell and you’re given less medication than you’d take for a headache. Think having someone forcefully hole-punch a part of the inside of your cheeks out and telling you do take 1 advil half an hour prior to the incision.

- Sunlight before screens. Letting the sun hit my eyes first thing (instead of my phone) lowers the day’s initial dopamine baseline and sets me up to feel steady.

- Hydration reset. A glass of water right away. Simple but grounding.

- Protein + tea ritual. A high-protein breakfast paired with something soothing but energizing like matcha, kombucha, or jasmine green tea. This calms my nervous system while waking me up.

- Move and sweat. Anything that gets my body moving.

- Deep work focus. A 2–3 hour morning block with zero phone usage. This always lifts my mood as I feel empowered and because consistency enlarges ability.

- Afternoon treat. A piece of good chocolate, or half-sugar milk tea if I want something sweeter.

- Books over phones. I carry a book or Kindle everywhere, ideally on a topic that connects with what I’m already excited about. This help replace idle scrolling with genuine curiosity and nurture my deep inner happiness.

- Evening movement. Barre, yoga, or Pilates to reset. A challenging enough core focus class where I outdo all my peers help me ground myself into one thing I know I’m good at and in control.

Otherwise, I consider it a request. I may feel  torn saying no, but I consider it a part of having human relationships. It's still up to me to uphold my boundaries. (A bit inconsiderate to make said requests when I'm vulnerable / overwhelmed / likely to give in or respond in ways that don't reflect how I am usually, though)

Zero secrets is something partners or anyone are entitled to. Because the truth is, 1. not all of them handle it 2. the secret may not be mine to tell (e.g. of a common frriend). But I would be willing to make exceptions for #1 [f someone demonstrated an ability to handle the secrets. Will they share the burden with me or add to it? Will it enrich our relationship or will it sidetrack us from our usual life and my usual capacity for other people? Do they have the skills for repair if they make a mistake? 

No relationship is entitled no matter how many people consider it normal. And when I mean relationship, I don't mean pre-marriage or pre-engagement.

I can express to my partner that it makes me uncomfortable that he goes out a lot and that I feel insecure. I can’t tell him he can’t go out. I don’t feel I have a right to do that even if he’s my husband. 

If he doesn’t change anything I will be hurt that he didn’t consider my emotions; not because he went as an action.

If he tells me I can’t go somewhere, I have to consider his opinion. I’m not married and I’ve been with someone recently in what turned out to be a casual set up. Nothing serious, but even when he expressed opinions about me doing certain things I felt uncomfortable doing them. 

For me personally the reason I didn’t feel I wanted to do something was out of loyalty; not fear or obligation even. I didn’t order him lunch recently and I felt guilt. I feel it’s an extension of my affection and respect for him. Same thing when he told me someone wronged him and I refused to pay service to that person to deal with them.

I follow the same rules that I've set. Look through my devices all you want just don't change anything. 

I'm the ""controlling"" crazy one though. And I say ""controlling"" in quotes because I don't stop anyone from doing anything I just enforce my boundaries.

That said I don't want to be in a relationship with someone that likes to do the things I don't like so I think it's better for them to date someone that won't mind. And I much rather be alone than have someone give up their interests for me.

If you feel like you need to check your partner you're in the wrong relationship.

AskWomen,Big-Guarantee-28,1nq1q6b,"Women of reddit, what is the fine line between acceptable and controlling between you and your partner?",84,0,31,Struckbyfire,ng4zpuf,"I think setting  hard rules for your partner like “you can’t go to clubs by yourself,” “you’re not allowed to text that friend” and expecting obedience without discussion or being open to compromise is controlling.

Sharing a boundary or preference is different. You can say, “I’m not comfortable with X,” and stay open to compromise, or decide it’s a deal breaker and leave if it doesn’t align with your values or they aren’t willing to budge (or even just accept their choice and let it go if you’re not willing to leave over it). That’s owning your limits, not policing theirs.

Control is about restricting someone else’s autonomy. Boundaries are about managing your own comfort and choices. The litmus test is, are you making a request that invites dialogue, or a rule they must obey to keep you happy. 

Like instead of “you can’t go out multiple nights a week”, you engage them and tell them how it makes you feel and see how they respond. And if they’re like “I am going to keep doing it” then you decide if you are willing to accept that (like, actually accept it and move on without constantly being upset at them and guilting them) or let them go.",1,2025-09-25,12:01:35

Obviously a healthy relationship has rules/boundaries/courtesies to which *both* agree to, that's how you build trust. The boundaries applying to both parties can always be rediscussed ans rewritten, if it seems sensible and both are open to change things. 

As an adult, you shouldn't have to ask your partner's permission to do something. You can check their opinion, if you want, but you should already be aware of their most important boundaries and what they feel is beyond them.

However, it's also okay to communicate your boundaries.

You need to be able to be in a relationship where you can trust your partner. If you don't feel in your gut that you can truly trust them, maybe they're not for you.

Also sometimes people just aren't compatible. If you're not comfortable with a partner who parties almost every night, or has a lot of friends or has a hard time being up front with things. Maybe they're just not the person for you.

AskWomen,Big-Guarantee-28,1nq1q6b,"Women of reddit, what is the fine line between acceptable and controlling between you and your partner?",84,0,31,hannibaltarantino,ng4vfwa,"To answer your question, I’m going to define the difference between rules, agreements, and boundaries:

Rules come from above us. They are handed down from an authority and don’t necessarily apply to the person/thing doling them out (i.e. “you are not allowed to go out to the club solo”)

Agreements are made between us. They are mutually agreed upon by all parties without coercion or threat of violence or negative consequences. (i.e. “we agree to not go out to the club solo and will only go together”).

Boundaries are self-made and self-enforced. You cannot place a boundary over someone else. You can only draw a boundary for yourself and it is up to you to enforce it. (i.e. “I will not be in a relationship with someone who regularly goes out to the club solo”). The difference between a boundary and an ultimatum is enforcement - ultimatums are manipulative because their intention is to change the behavior of someone else without really requiring to uphold your boundary.

In a healthy relationship, there are usually a good amount of agreements and boundaries. But when I see a relationship that is riddled with mostly rules, it’s a big red flag. Even when these rules are “two way,” if they are primarily being dolled out by one person, this screams insecurity and controlling behavior. Even worse is when these rules are disguised as boundaries or agreements. “I have a boundary that you can’t do xyz” is not a boundary. Or “I don’t want either of us doing xyz” but it’s not enthusiastically consented to by the other partner.

I have a feeling that if you’re asking this question here, these “agreements” may not actually be agreements. Listen to your gut. And maybe spend some time thinking about your own boundaries - what are you willing and not willing to tolerate in a relationship? And how do you plan to enforce them?",1,2025-09-25,11:41:24

I had a fantastic experience; I made really great friends and got into a relationship that we kept going long distance for another few years after I came home. Coming home was rough, to put it mildly, and while I was sitting in the airport waiting for my flight, I was sobbing my heart out as quietly as I could, so as not to bother other people. This older woman, maybe in get 50s or 60s? Came and sat with me, asked me about my year, and gave me the biggest hug. I never got her name, but that gesture was so unexpected and appreciated, and I still remember it over a decade later. There was another woman that I met while waiting for a connecting flight who was in a wheelchair, and she gave me money to buy us each a drink from the duty free shop. Unfortunately, prices had gone up a lot since the last time she did something like that, so she only had enough for her own drink, but I bought myself something with my own money and never told her.

AskWomen,LongGiraffe10,1nq7nzw,How do you fairly split household chores with your partner?,54,0,26,Jooles95,ng50zes,"We both work full-time (my husband does 8:00-16:45 Mon-Thur and 8:00-12:30 on Fri in the office with a 10-minute commute each-way, while I WFH 8:00-15:30 Mon-Fri), have two pets and no kids.

Because I’m at home a lot more, I tend to do a lot of the small day-to-day stuff that I can easily do during breaks/short periods of downtime - I take care of the laundry (separating, washing, hanging and then folding when dry), dusting and dishes, and keep on top of the cat’s litterbox during the day. I also clean the bathrooms, since I’m very particular with how the toilets, sinks and shower/tub are kept. 

My husband, on the other hand, does a lot of the ‘chunkier’ tasks when he’s home - stuff like garden work, hoovering (we have a Roborock that runs daily, but with a cat and a large dog we still need to break out the big hand-held hoover every weekend to keep on top of all the shedding), small repairs, and the like.

Cooking is split 50/50 - we usually cook together while talking about our day, and we each cook on our own once a week to give the other a break. The same goes for tasks that are easier when tag-teaming, like changing the sheets and tidying up the house.

Of course, things are not always entirely fair - there are weeks where he’ll be stressed and exhausted after work and I’ll pick up more slack, and others where my Lupus or migraines are flaring up and he’ll have to do more than his fair share to compensate. What’s important is that we always work as a team and express gratitude to each other for doing things that benefit us both at the end of the day.",1,2025-09-25,12:07:36

I do all the laundry, plan the meals and make grocery lists, pay the bills, manage our daughter's doctor's appointments and play dates. I do most of the cooking, he cooks when I assign him the task. 

We take turns doing the dishes every night--one person gets our daughter ready for bed and the other puts leftovers away, unloads and loads the dishwasher, takes out the garbage if full, and feeds the cats. We also generally split daycare pick up and drop-off, one does one and the other does the other. Who does what varies depending on work schedules, sometimes there's a day where one person does both.

More specific cleaning tasks like vacuuming or wiping down sinks, it's really just whoever sees it and feels like it needs doing.

I once had a partner who didn't enjoy washing the dishes (TBF, neither did I). But the thing is, I loved cooking. So what happened was either I experience less joy having to tone down my cooking or they experience less joy doing more dishes than what they do when they cook. Neither of us was wrong, but it was a clear instance of incompatibility, especially since we didn't have a lot of energy nir oney to hire someone else to do it.

Step two: Make talking, not resenting from unspoken/normalized expectations, a habit in the relationship.

Step three: As much as your ability allows, do things just because. It's sweet. There will come a point when you know each other enough that you know how something needs to be done. As long as you feel fulfilled doing a little more than your fair share, you're free to do it.

(Nuance: Note how always doing this can break their habit. Part of care is helping them maintain their habits and helping yourself maintaining your boundaries. It's not a character flaw, it's how habits work. Don't cry martyr. It's too easy to.)

It doesn't need to be exact.  It doesn't need to be tit for tat.  But both partners should be paying attention, noticing the things their partners are doing for the unit, acknowledging when their partner has been putting in more effort than them, and trying to even it out.

That might look like, on days when one person works from home but the other goes into the office, the work from home person might get dinner started during the other person's commute.  Then they get home, ask if there's something they can do to help with dinner, and if their partner says no, they might *find something else to do*.  Take out the trash, walk the dog, vacuum the living room, keep doing productive things until dinner is served.  Eat dinner together, both clean up after dinner together, then both people are free to do whatever they want with their evening.  As long as one person is ""on duty"", you're also on duty.  Find something to do.

Now let's say I have a day off and my partner doesn't.  And let's saywe both have reasonably equal amounts of time off so there will be days that they have off and I don't.  I might sleep in while my partner goes to work.  I might have some personal projects that I want to get done on my day off, and I want to relax.  It's fair that I do that, but I notice that I'm having a good time while my partner is working, and I feel a little bit bad about it.  I might during my day run a couple small errands that normally we would have had to do together before going back to my relaxing vacation day.  And when my partner comes home and tries to help me with dinner I might say ""Nono!  You sit down and relax, I've been off all day.""  I acknowledge the imbalance, I do a little more work, I feel a little less bad.  It doesn't need to be exactly equal, if we're both doing this, I have trust that there will be days when they've got the day off and I don't and they'll enjoy their time off but also use a little bit of that time to make both of our lives easier.  I don't have to keep doing shit like this, or keep track of how many times I've had days like this and my partner hasn't, it all comes out in the wash.  But both people just pay attention and acknowledge when they are working and their partner isn't and vaguely aim to notice the effort and make it *sort of equal*.",1,2025-09-25,12:33:49

One of us will chuck a load of washing on and then we both hang it out, even if it's just handing items and pegs so the other can just do the hanging bit. Then we both fold and put away together.

We will cook and clean simultaneously. As one person dirties stuff the other rinses and packs the dishwasher. And we cook together.

One will vacuum while the other mops.

He will clean the toilet while I clean the sinks etc.

My career field is very competitive and while a degree certainly opens doors, it's having experience that will land you a good, full time permanent position.

I definitely would have focused on gaining more relevant experience while I was in school now that I know better. But I don't think I could have taken a gap year.

I had an actual BOOK I had to follow about what the kids could eat, when, and how much. It was like a binder with pictures and instructions. I had to measure and WEIGH certain foods, I was only allowed to use the exact ingredients in any recipe I cooked (not a food allergy thing), and I couldn’t buy anything from anywhere but approved organic stores and the specific product down to the brand and size. 

I once bought this fancy juice they let the kids have tiny glasses of with dinner, but I bought like the size up because it was on sale and was already like $20 or something crazy. The mom came home, saw it in the fridge, un-opened, said, “this is too much!” and threw it in the trash.

The whole family are built like linebackers, but mum was the equivalent of the homecoming queen in the 70s.
Cue me, born in the 90s, also built like a sporty linebacker since I was young. Mum would underfeed me, stating that 600 calories is enough for young women (i was 10, in multiple sports and always active but still BIG). I was always introduced as ""Big Ash"" to strangers and family alike, mum brings up how she noticed I ""started stuffing my face at my friend's 6th birthday party"".

I've never liked myself or my body, because when you're that age, mum KNOWS everything and she didn't like me or my body, so no one should.

That shit really sticks with you. Ive now got majorly disordered eating but still get to be overweight, despite undergoing incredibly drastic measures including surgery, fasting for 3 months straight and other stupid things that are hard to admit.

A few years ago, I invited mum to stay with me overnight when I was out of town on a work trip. Flew her out, paid for the room myself. As we're getting into bed, I roll to turn the lights out, and this woman laughs. Not a giggle, not a huff; laughs and says ""wow you look exactly like a pig. I don't just mean fat, i mean exactly like a pig"".

Not “you’re handsome.” I mean the oddly specific stuff.

So tell me: What’s that oddly specific praise you never get, but would absolutely make your day?

""Your hugs are wonderful and feel very nice and safe.""  
I heard it not only my gf at that time, bzt also from various friends of all genders.  

Pro tip: hug them tightly and reposition arms as needed to get as much contact with them and as little free space between you as possible (upper body only for friends, whole body when apropriate). Stand proudly on stable legs, hold them firmly, but don't suffocate them, close your eyes, breathe steadily and enjoy the moment, enjoy how close you are. Imagine you are wrapping the universe around them and be mindful of their movement: if they want to reposition arms or body weight, let them. If they want to release the hug and let go, let them. When either of you wants to stop, release the hug slowly, so it doesn't end abruptly. The transition from hug to standing alone should be gradual, as if unwrapping your individual universes from one another. Also, there might occasionaly be a little dizziness, so be careful not to let each other fall or stumble.",59,2025-09-27,13:57:05

during the obama administration. regulations made to curb emissions didnt cover all car sizes, which instead encouraged auto makers to simply make trucks and suvs bigger to avoid facing the same emissions regulations. this, combined with the intentional association of large, powerful trucks with masculinity as a marketing tactic (despite the fact that it has nothing to do with masculinity and 99.99% of men have no need for anything larger than a 90s hilux) meant that these bigger pickups sold like hotcakes, incentivizing both more big trucks and even bigger trucks than before. that both costs more (due to the obvious size change, added electronics, safety features, etc.) and allowed the auto makers to tack a hefty premium onto it, because people were willing to pay it because they perceive a huge pickup truck as being much more worth 70k than a small pickup, even if the size change is nowhere near correlated with the price hike.",189,2025-09-27,01:46:52

The short beds are a result of inexperienced drivers, cab size and the long wheelbase problems that long beds cause when turning or parking. My truck is a crew cab and has a 6.75' bed and I don't fit into Home Depot parking spots length wise sometimes! My supervisors have crew cabs with 8' beds and it's a big difference in turning radius even though the bed is only 1.25 feet longer. 

I do agree that a Maverick or Ranger would suffice for most potential truck owners and I would recommend anyone that thinks they ""need"" a truck start there. If you're comparing your minivan's or SUV's hauling abilities to a truck in this thread, then you most certainly DO NOT need a truck! If I had a choice, I'd pick something small and fun like a Ranger Raptor that is capable all around, but small and efficient. 

In my case I had to switch up to an F-250 a few years ago because the loads I was hauling/towing were putting the F-150 I had at the limits of it's capabilities regularly. There is a gigantic difference between the way F-150 sized trucks handle work compared to the bigger, commercial style F-250 & F-350 sized trucks. Even though my current F-250 only weighs a 1,000 or so lbs more than my old F-150, it does it's job with much more confidence. Towing 7,000 or so pounds in an F-150 rated for 9,500 lbs towing can be downright nerve racking compared to towing even 18,000 lbs with the F-250 that's rated for 21,000 lbs towing. I did pick the nicer Lariat trim because I'm wanted leather, adaptive cruise control and other stuff, but the fact that people are getting $100k platinums and never putting anything in the bed just causes the rest of the people that need big trucks to have to spend more every time we get a new one.",4,2025-09-27,11:05:19

When did pick up trucks went from functional and normal to the beast that is on the road today that looks like a SUV with a 5 foot bed attached to it.,108,0,191,The_World_Is_A_Slum,nghsb6u,"One thing that’s never mentioned is that there are very few comfortable and practical vehicles for tall or big men. I’m well over 6’, and am very uncomfortable in most sedans and crossovers, while almost all full-size pickups are very comfortable for long drives. The seats are larger, the upright seating position gives plenty of support, and I can do ten hours behind the wheel and still walk.

I am constantly harping on the fact that dealers and manufacturers refuse to put base model trucks on the lots, the death of regular cabs, and the size explosion. Stellantis killed regular cabs, GM won’t let you order a regular cab with any decent options, and Ford only makes the regular cab in XL trim, although it comes with the desirable power train, unlike GM. The increase in physical size is nothing but bulk for the sake of bulk. The front overhang and hood height are the greatest offense. Shortening the hood and overhang could get us a nice reduction in overall length.

As for the crew cab/stubby bed - it makes the truck less useful for me, so I wish that there were more available options, but that seems to be what people want. Most of my customers would be better served by a full-size SUV, which brings me to my last thought. I’m a service advisor at a truck accessory shop, and many of my customers are white-collar desk jockeys, while others are in construction, ranching or other ag, various trades or outdoor types. The white collar guys are hilarious with the cosplay bullshit, and their lack of general automotive knowledge is consistently surprising. Yes, those guys are buying expensive trucks and tricking them out to appear more masculine.",0,2025-09-27,12:28:13

Depending on your situation, you may be fresh out of college or recently moved away from your home town and in a new life situation.


In college/school you have so many friends around you all the time but when you start a 9-5 that just breaks down UNLESS you make the effort to maintain it. 


If you're like me, that was my problem. Friends take *effort* in adulthood. Scheduling. I have to use a fucking calendar to keep track of shit. 


Try to make friends locally that you can meet up with on weeknights at a brewery or something. 


 I basically settled on:


- get out of the house for FUN reasons at least once a week (for me its mountain biking/hiking), meeting up with friends at a bar, concerts, etc.
- exercise regularly 
- make an effort to make friends even if youre introverted (sounds like you're not though)

Pick one subject, person or event and study it in depth for 1 hour a day for 6 months, and then switch to another subject, person, or event and repeat. Learn to cook healthy food so you can spend 45 minutes to one hour testing and preparing good meals or baking for yourself and others. Study and practice good conversation. 

You will find doing these will lay down a pattern too utilize your time, very productively in a self reinforcing manner that will make you healthy, fit, knowledgeable, attractive, engaging, attractive, and probably wealthy because you will carry the effects of them with you into the workplace.

I spend a lot of chill nights playing video games, doing gardening, watching shows with my partner, experimenting with new recipes, gym and see friends . So the basics. On the more interesting side, I do 3D printing for fun, learn Japanese and just on a whim try new hobbies to add to my collection to do on a weekend. Lately it’s been kayaking and snorkelling. Surprisingly very accessible snd something I picked up in a recent day trip to an island, which was also quite accessible and cheap. 

Tomorrow I’m going to a flower festival. So keeping up with local events is good too. 

Sometimes I’ll get creative and do something whacky like recently I invited a few friends over and we tried 10 different types of apples and ranked which is the best. Now we all have an apple we love that we eat in the regular (Kanzi by the way). 

There’s a million small things you can do a whim that’s fun. Here’s a few that I like doing: audiobooks, bike riding, skate boarding, flying a kite (honestly so much more fun than it appears), pottery workshop, making a bouquet of flowers, trying a new food, going to a new cafe, art, hiking, axe throwing. In my opinion, there’s countless things to do. It’s just about getting started one one of them and getting past the initial hump of “I don’t know how to do this”",1,2025-09-27,10:23:11

And the next time you’re on a date, and they ask what you did on the weekend, you can tell them something interesting like “I went to the observatory to look at the stars” instead of “not much, just chilled”.

Entertaining yourself on your own in this digital age also leaves you with a large variety of options. You can go to the gym, pick up another sport or a hobby, read, write, watch movies, make or listen to music, get a dog and spend your time with that, plan a trip and/or do more weekend trips, get a girlfriend or a boyfriend to spend time with, start cooking and/or baking and the list goes on...

When I was your age I was never at home, I was always out with my friends and if not I was with my GF. Then again, I don't know which country you are from and the youth I had does not exist anymore because social media ruined social contacts for most of the western world. We didn't even have mobile phones for the beginning of my youth. I remember we had to use a payphone in the streets to call your friend's house phone to ask the parents if your friend had already left home and what time he/she left so you could calculate at what time he/she would be arriving at the place you agreed to meet..

If you can get a head start on your career somehow by getting a professional license or some certificates, study for those exams in your free time.

Running, drawing, reading, flying, 3D printing and modeling, programming, video games, ham radio, collecting and listening to vinyl records, collecting baseball cards, geocaching…

I’d say every 6 months or so I pick up a new hobby and try it, some things stick some don’t but it’s fun to learn something new. Some stuff costs some money, like flying, I had to save up quite a bit to get my license. But others are very cheap or free, ham radio can be started with an online test and a $20 radio from amazon and you can talk to people on all sorts of local repeaters, of course you could spend thousands on radio equipment if you wanted to.

I do highly recommend learning to cook because it will save lots of money (unless your diet is already all cheap empty calories as it is, but in that case it will improve your health tremendously). You gotta eat anyway, and cooking for people is not only fun, but rewarding. Girls love a guy who can cook, too.

I think Android Development, learning to solder well and design circuits, and woodworking dominated my 30s. Music remained a big part as well, but with a focus on audio engineering and recording other peoples bands.

My 40s have included video game history, playing a lot of BoTW and ToTK (Zelda games), more politics, getting back into making music after a hiatus due to COVID, getting back into video editing, learning a lot of AI-related things in ComfyUI, and learning how to just relax and watch YouTube or anime instead of always feeling compelled to be doing something.

It's bad for friendship, because you're relying on your friends too much. If my friends cancel on me for whatever reason I'm never sad or angry in the slightest, because I have infinite amount of stuff to do in or outside of home. 

Not having hobbies is bad for your brain, because you need that activity and stimulation that's different from your primary job.

I  can be a major flirt but a few years ago I became friends with a great guy and don't want to do anything that would jeopardize that friendship. We have been intentional to set boundaries so we'll stay friends and not try to be more than that. So I'm intentional about not commenting on his body. But last time we met he mentioned that he's going on an intense diet despite his doctors' concerns because he wants to lose weight to get women's attention (he told me that was his reason). The more I looked into the specifics of the diet, the more concerned I got so I want to talk to him about it. I've had conversations like this with other girls but it goes into that hyping zone where if we were lesbians it'd be flirting. I want him to know he's already attractive and doesn't need to lose weight for that, but I don't want to come off as flirting or anything. Do you have any ideas what I should do?

AskMen,marrymeinvegas,1ns0lzf,How do I tell my friend he doesn't need to change to be attractive without flirting?,79,0,113,TheNobleMushroom,ngjyb5h,"Okay, two things here. 

Firstly this whole,""You're good enough as you are and deserve better"" talk works within girl groups, it doesn't work as a girl talking to a guy that you friend zoned. Not just that but you literally say you can be a major flirt and clearly have a sensual vibe to you, which he's being rejected off of. 

Guys respond more to evidence. Things that can see and experience first hand, rather than words. It will not make any sense to him if you tell him he's attractive as is while simultaneously friendzoning him. In his mind, he's registering,""I have been nice to her all this time and she still hasn't sucked my cock, so I must be unattractive"". Because that's the cold head evidence that's been presented to him. 

Secondly, doctors are good for somethings and not great for others. They're good for your stock standard, prescribing antibiotics for minor bacterial stuff but that's about it. They're not the right people to go to for physique optimization stuff. And even keeping it strictly within the health realm, many issues are escalated to a specialist who knows better than 99% of the doctors you can directly access and that whole process can take years, depending on where you live. 

I'll use myself as an example. My creatinine levels are always ""elevated"". I say that in quotes because nobody actually knows what the upper limit for creatinine is (not creaTINE mind you). Doctors just work off of what gen pop averages are. Me, being a competitive power lifter that's six pack shredded year round, lifting weights 5 times a week, swimming six times a week ; I don't really fit in as ""gen pop"". So my creatinine levels are always higher than the average, overweight, sedentary desk worker who gets out of breath by tying their shoe laces. So if I go to one of these GPs they're going to tell me my kidneys are failure and I need a liver transplant and that I have blood poisoning and am about to die in 48 hours. That ""48 hours till you die"" has been going on for the last 26 years funnily enough 😂 Because what these GPs consider as a normal range, is actually just ""average human range"" and right now, we live in a world where being an average human (especially in the western world) is incredibly unhealthy.

Edit - also on the note of carnivore diet I would recommend avoiding black and white thinking. There's much more depth to this. Macros, micronutrients, total calories, his blood work, his hormonal levels, how much fat he has to lose or muscle to gain, his existing diet and whether this is an improvement or not. Etc etc. Using myself as an example again I ran carnivore during my last cutting phase. Dropped 12kg in 6 weeks of pretty much pure fat, while retaining all my muscle, no loss in strength on any of my weight lifting movements. Blood work showed improvements in all factors and stable hormonal levels. Energy and mood felt the best it has ever been at such a low bodyfat percentage. Was also pleasantly surprised to see some long term allergies and digestive issues clear up!",4,2025-09-27,19:17:35

He's not going to keel over and die if he just eats meat for a few months. If he's trying to make a permanent change that's a bit different and would require keeping better tabs on his nutrition and health but otherwise it's nothing to worry about.

I’m 18, and I’m a freshman in college. Back in early high school, my hormones were raging, but this settled down in after my freshman year.

A couple days ago, I’ve decided to ask out this one girl. Today, I meet the most gorgeous girl I have ever met, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off of her. 

I thought the horrible hormones went away, or at least lessened. WHY DO THEY COME BACK. When did they finally settle down for you guys?

It never goes away. In your teens (high school) your priorities are school. And maybe a part time job if you are working to save money. You don't pay rent. Maybe you bought your own car - used. You have less priorities. Your hormones (and among other 13-18 year olds) are all over the place. Your body and brain are still growing. Men at 18 have an incredible amount of testosterone. Which equates to also having a high libido.  

There was study done in the UK back in 2002. Study on
Married men in their 40s who only have sex with their wives once a month and it was scheduled. 100 men took the study most of them had a difficult time getting erections and blamed lack of sex drive due to ED. 

The study then individually interviewed each men (in their underwear) thinking they are going to be evaluated by a medical doctor. A very sexy, attractive and curvy therapist wearing what look's like a provocative drs white coat was performing heart beat check, blood pressure check and visual check of the eyes. While the blood pressure and heart rate monitor was attached, Woman would get closer and closer to the man
And the man's heart rate and blood pressure spiked. They also noticed a ""rise"" of erection...

The bonus side effect is women find you attractive AF, opportunities arise, it happens. The only reason women go for older is that they find the above, or think they do.

AskMen,Geokcall-69,1nrq4a2,Why shouldn’t young men spend their 20 chasing women?,198,0,108,Gladiateher,nggys96,"In general, one should only chase something worth pursuing, women as a general class aren’t worth chasing. I have personally made this mistake and know it first hand.

Women make up over 50% of the population and frankly most people aren’t worth your time, which is a rule women are no exception to. Therefore the vast majority of women aren’t worth your time. Women aren’t special in this regard, people are people and a lot of people suck. 

This is really easy to misunderstand as a young man though because a woman can have unbelievable god given angelic beauty on the outside, but still have the heart of a selfish, ruthless, asshole.

For a large variety of reasons it’s much better to have a small, strong network of worthwhile people in your life, close friends and confidants, and perhaps one good woman. You may get lucky and have a larger network, but there’s only so many people you’ll encounter that it will be worth cultivating a friendship with.

Now, if you find a good woman, a woman with strength of character, a sharp mind, shrewdness, goals, compassion, wisdom, morals, honor, a sense of duty, a sense of humor, who is loyal, fair, and on the square, a woman who you are proud to know and who raises others up instead of tearing them down, she is gonna be worth pursuing with everything you have. That’s a woman that will make every single aspect of your life better, and will make you better every year you’re around her. She won’t be perfect, no human is, but good people are out there, and they’re the ones worth pursuing.

Tupac Shakur once said that one good woman is worth a thousand hoes. And it couldn’t be more true, in fact one awful hoe can ruin your life, while one good woman can help you reach the stars.

But Gladiateher, you ask, “what about just banging hoes to get the experience/fond memories before settling down?”

That’s exactly the type of mistake that’s too easy to make, the fact is you don’t just take a few hits of heroine to make a few fond memories, hoes are an addictive substance as well and will drag you down and stomp you if you let them. Plus, if you’re pursuing hoes you instantly become much less attractive to most of the good women.

On the flip side: opportunity cost. Your 20s are the best decade you have for growth. Personal growth through education, training, career, sport, whatever. This is the time you can most easily build yourself into the type of person you want to be going forward, humans are highly plastic and whatever you pursue is what you’ll excel in long term. 

The more time you waste on hoes, the less time you have to create the type of person you want to be. 

Lastly, any young men who read this, put some money in a ROTH IRA when you can. Every dollar you put in now could be worth 25 or 30 times more when you’re at retirement age.",1,2025-09-27,09:42:33

Fact is, men don’t become less attractive in their 30s unless they’re out of shape and poor financially. If you have both, you’re not gonna have trouble attracting women in your 30s.

However, if you primarily structure your life around chasing women in your 20s with your youth, that’s time lost that also could have been spent building yourself to become a better version of yourself.

Source: me. I spent my 20s grinding my career, reading more books, trying to be more “productive” instead of maximizing social time, etc. I stayed fit too, and only got fitter every year. I have had no issues with women. If anything, women have found me more attractive as I have grown older, and pretty much all have found the fact that I don’t focus on women much to be a bonus since it (to them) implies I have discipline, etc.

Trust me. You’re not gonna be stuck lonely because you didn’t find a partner in your 20s. I find that men who only have their youth/looks as part of their “worth” are the ones who say this. You should become more attractive as you age, not less, if you’re a guy.",1,2025-09-27,13:25:10

AskMen,Geokcall-69,1nrq4a2,Why shouldn’t young men spend their 20 chasing women?,198,0,108,fffangold,ngib272,"A lot of people here are saying don't chase, and I think they are missing the meaning of your question (or intentionally answering what they want of course).

But the reason is simple. Meeting people, and by extension dating, is a lot easier when you're younger. So if you want a lifelong partner at some point in your life, the best time to find someone is when it's easy to meet people. Ideally in college. Don't stay with someone who isn't right for you of course. In fact, if she isn't right for you, drop her fast so you can find someone who is right for you.

But if you find someone who is a good fit for your life, do everything you can to keep her and build a life with her. As a note, part of someone being a good fit is that she puts in a similar effort as you to the relationship - it doesn't have to be literal 50/50 in every aspect of life, but you should both be contributing in ways so that you both are lifted up by each other.

The grass is not greener on the other side. Yes, in some ways men get more attractive to women as we get older. But that's not a universal truth, and even if we're more attractive, it's still harder to meet people as you get older and have more responsibilities. And most people have more baggage as they get older too. Both men and women.

Basically, feel free to date lots of women. But when you find the right one, don't keep going wondering if there's someone better. There may be, but there probably isn't. So when you find the right one, build a life with her instead of just chasing the next infaturation or hottie. Ten years down the line you'll thank yourself for sticking with someone great instead of just chasing tail the whole time.

Yes, it's possible it may not work out. But if you ever plan to settle down, you have to take that risk at some point, and doing it young means you have a better chance of being with the right lady, and if it does blow up you still have a chance to start over if you want that.

If you never want to settle down... well, then you don't care about chasing in just your 20's, and that's a different question.",1,2025-09-27,14:02:36

However, I do not let it get me down because I:

1) Was a D1 gymnast in the past and kept the physique
2) I make a lot of money
3) My job is of high interest to women (literal romance author) and gets me lots of excited conversations
4) I built a strong amount of equity in my social skills when I was younger

With all of the above, I have no problem saying I am a 5/10 in looks because I honestly hit at the weight of a 7/10 when all things are added on top of the looks.

I found them attractive but I have zero game and just be myself. Also, I was a bit shy in my teens and throughout my 20s.


And I am not trying to be arrogant. I personally think I'm just a regular looking dude. But in all seriousness I never had an issue attracting women in different settings.

I’m in a position where I only see this man while he’s shopping cause I happen to work at said place. 

Just trying to get into a guys headspace about how you might approach rejecting them. 

I’m talking about purely because you know nothing about them other than their appearance and they cold approached you. 

Do you feel any type of anxiety or disgust for them asking? Or do you feel like some kind of second hand embarrassment that they even bothered?

However, I have found that ""negative"" compatibility, meaning how each person copes with things like stress or conflict, is at least as important. A relationship that may be great when you are both doing well but falls apart when one or both of you is struggling can't really last in a healthy way. 

For example, one person might turn inward or pull away when they are upset, while the other person needs reassurance or feels insecure. That fundamental incompatibility takes a huge toll in the long run, much more so than something like preferring different hobbies or media.",1,2025-09-27,15:54:36

2- never sacrifice who you are, nor betray your principles for a woman (you won't be able to recover if you lose what's best in you)
3- everyone is bad in bed the first time they have sex, but the good thing about just having one person is that you don't need to perform with the same person, nor try to impress them in bed, they already know what you are like and it will often be funny 
4- sex, despite being very good, if it is the most fun thing in your relationship, this indicates serious problems 
5- never force the relationship, go after someone who also comes to you, someone who wants you and is willing to be with you 
6- never say I love you too soon 
7- don't be useless at home, be the one who does everything your wife needs, solves all the problems in the house, fixes the shower, changes the light bulb, unclogs the sink drain, etc... Work that every man should know how to do 
8- always have a firm opinion and don’t give in for any silly reason, women hate it when we agree with everything they say
9- be rational and know how to say no to your wife, remember you are the main pillar, you are the one who has to maintain a rigid posture (women are not someone who lives doing their will)
10- have a life of your own, don't live just for it, women love to see us have a reserved side, have our own hobby, time for ourselves, to invest in ourselves, to work on our own projects",0,2025-09-27,00:39:38

AskMen,ZachTF,1nrje9y,What’s the story behind your first kiss with your romantic partner? How did you guys feel afterwards?,13,0,7,utopicunicornn,ngfil4q,"Skipping the first kisses from previous women I’ve been with, because those were uneventful in comparison with the one I shared with the one girl who would eventually become my wife, it’s a bit funny I guess. Maybe lol. 

So one day she texted me asking if I wanted to hang out with her and I was like “Sure!” We spent a few hours at the mall, talked a lot, we walked around, and had dinner together. After the mall closed for the night, she brought up how she remembered that I had mentioned at some point that I love seeing the night sky and the stars, and she thought that I might like the view of the night sky at a certain field in town and she would like to take me there, to which I agreed to. 

Once we got there, we spent maybe an hour or so looking at the stars. We eventually found a wooden bench to sit at to rest our weary legs. Not long after I felt her body nuzzle up against mine, and she rested her head on my shoulders. It took me a while to process what was going on, I turned my head to look at her. She looked back at me, and she went for the kill and kissed me right on the lips. 

For the past few months, I was crushing so hard on this girl, like every minute without her and I missed her terribly. So when she kissed me, I wasn’t sure if I was dreaming or something, but then the reality sunk in and I jerked back! She had this terrified and worried look on her face, which seemed to say “Oh god what have I done?! I’ve ruined everything!” But I explained to her that it had been awhile since I’ve gone out with a girl, so I’m sorry if I’m rusty and I hope she wouldn’t judge me for that. Luckily she was (and still is) a very understanding woman and she told me it was perfectly fine, it didn’t matter to her one bit, so let’s give this another try. 

That was like 13 years ago, and my wife still teases me about the time I pulled away from our first kiss lol.",7,2025-09-27,01:50:06

A simple date at a barely filled bar with a small music duo turned into something with potential. Her glances at me had the brightest smiles-pretty sure she was interested. When the group finished around 10 we called it a night. I gave her a respectful kiss on the cheek as we left. After a day of messaging we agreed to do dinner & a movie the next night. Never went to the movie because we talked for hours. Got back to my place so she could head back home. Another respectful kiss this time on the lips was followed by more talking/laughing, another kiss, laughing and more talking. Because it was cold out I suggested we at least get back in my car so we could sit. Within minutes we were necking like teenagers. It went on till 4 in the morning before she left.  Lots of dates followed & eventually marriage. We both chuckle that there was immediate attraction and over 4 hours of necking on the 2nd date was a clear sign of good things.

She then walks back to her group of friends.  

About 30 min later she comes back intoxicated and we hit it off. We hook up in the venue. All my work colleagues saw, and so did her friends/work colleagues. It became gossip for months. She told me she really wanted to have sex. But I told myself not to go further than kissing because she was intox. This happened another 2 times but never progressed past kissing (damn morals). 

She gave me her number. I went to find her at work a few days later to see if she would like to go out but she wasn’t working. So I messaged her and it turns out that although she wants the same thing, I am too young. Turns out she’s 30 (not an issue for me) but I respect her preferences. She pulled the “I’m glad I could find a friend I could trust” card. After a couple weeks of joking around and being friendly, she gave me the cold shoulder.

AskMen,Catontheroof89,1ns21cv,How do you guys move on a soft rejection when there were some emotions?,21,0,5,AutoModerator,nginzeo,"Here's an original copy of /u/Catontheroof89's post (if available):

Hey guys, looking for some advice on moving past a minor rejection. I'm a 36M who recently started taking salsa classes from scratch. It's been an amazing confidence booster.

There's a woman in the class (she is in her early 40s) who was one of the first partners kind enough to dance with me when I was a beginner. We'd chat, she'd ask personal questions (if I live alone, what I do weekends, etc.), and I developed a bit of a crush. The mixed signals had me in the ""is she/isn't she"" loop.

Last week, after a social event, I finally shot my shot and asked her out for coffee. Her response was the classic gentle let-down: she said ""how sweet"" (""tan tierno"" in Spanish, which is a soft no here), said she didn't have time, but maybe a tequila another day (vague future).

**Logically, I get it.** I'm not pursuing it further; I respect her answer and won't make it weird in class. I wasn't in love, but the attachment to the *idea* of her still stings a bit. It's more about the bruised ego and the ""what if"" fading away.

For the guys who've been there: **What's your best mental reset button?** How do you flip the switch from dwelling on the ""no"" back to focusing on your own mission? Any practical steps you take to shake off that feeling?

Thanks in advance.

I think we're all different and some will be able to simply move on seconds later, others will let it linger.

I've had very little luck dating in the last 2 years since my ex-fiance ended things.  Been on a lot of dates, even had 2 girlfriends for shorter durations, but nothing has stuck.

I'm also 46, so the 'time is running out' thing makes it harder sometimes to move on even from something that never really was.  I have to take a step back and realize I'm not really mad that I'm not going to have a chance with the particular person, but more just agitated that this is a ton of work with few payoffs.

Here, over the last month I was dating someone.  We went on 6 dates.  TBH, I really wasn't even that interested from the beginning as I actually matched by mistake with her.  However, the fact that actually wanted to go out on a date and we had subsequent dates made me want to at least try.

For whatever reason, she just stopped messaging me starting last Sunday.  To be the 'adult' I sent a temp reading text on Wed just saying 'hey how's it going, back in the routine' as she had been away visiting her son for 4 days.  All I got back was 'Yes, back at work.'

She responded, but obviously the response and the fact I havent' heard from her since told me that it was done.

However, I quickly remembered that I never really was interested to begin with and that by our 3rd date, I internally knew it wasn't going anywhere.  Just something about her energy or lacktherof.

I've posted elsewhere about this, how in the 6 dates, I don't think she asked me more than 1 question about myself.  Not even as a follow-up to something I tee'd up for her to comment on.

So, it's not really 'her' that I'm unhappy about, but just the fact that's it's another 'failure'",5,2025-09-27,15:23:05

I have issues from having a horrible father myself so doing anything that could make me seem remotely like a bad guy terrifies me into thinking I’ll be a bad father and that’s one of my biggest fears ever. Maybe I’m overthinking this and I should just go with the flow? I’m way less edgy than I used to be and for some reason it’s bothering me.

I'm in the final year of my clg and for the last week I'm staying in my room, I feel stuck in a loop of hopelessness, no motivation & work. I have observed that this is a pattern I keep falling into every 1-2 months. 



A little context about my life - I was working on a funded startup 2 months back, I had a purpose in life, which is no longer there, as we failed.

 I still have small problems to solve for people, but I'm no longer motivated to work, and it's draining me from the inside.

 Earlier in my childhood, I had built things, and I was a ""Desire Driven Person rather than a fear driven"" I built for the joy of building, and I miss that version of myself. 

my question to you guys is how you keep yourself driven and motivated?

Is there any book which may help me? But I feel like there is a greater appeal for something deeper, something that rebuilds strength from the inside out. I want to build things which I have always dreamt.

TL;DR - What keeps you motivated and keeps you going in life? Plz Suggest resources which may help others & me.

OK, so now I know that I need the inventory of bags, the professional booth that is both structurally sound and modular for assembly and teardown, and invites to those events. And in order to achieve all of those, there are hundreds of little tasks that need to be done between now and then.

So on a spreadsheet that I keep, I have a small set of little accomplishments that I need to achieve every day or throughout the week. This keeps me motivated because every day’s tasks are attainable but require definite time and attention. It feels like I’m staying on top of things to do this little bit every day.

For context, I don't mean literal hermits, just dudes who got stayed single (but occasionally gets horizontal with women) all their life. 

I'm 27 now, never been in a relationship, but have danced the horizontal tango in college. From what I've observed, it really just seems like relationships are a pain; they're unpredictable. The fighting, the heartbreak, the mistrust, etc., it's a damn ouroboros. Friends and family give me flack whenever I say ""I don't want to start a family, I'm happy being single."".

I have a good job with good pay, huge savings because I don't have dependents. I can indulge if I want to, but I don't. 

People have told me time and time again that I ""need to start a family"" or  ""it's a waste, since you're handsome"" (this one annoys me more that it should because I barely do anything to change my appearance, I just keep myself clean and decent).

Health-wise I'm fine, both physically and mentally; career-wise, I'm happy.

So what gives?

AskMen,destroyerdandelion,1ns67wk,Anyone have experience with the madonna-whore complex?,14,0,0,SadSickSoul,ngk9dx3,"I don't know if this ties to the wider phenomenon as folks generally experience it, but my experience with it is very personal and heavily tied into my own insecurities and anxieties about sexuality, romance, physical and emotional intimacy. I compartmentalize a lot of my feelings, my needs and my feelings about my needs because, for reasons I don't care to go into right now, I find human sex and sexuality to be an inherently shameful, harmful and degrading thing; the end result is that I tend towards instinctively thinking of people as someone I find sexually attractive vs those I find emotionally attractive that I would want to spend time with, with basically no overlap simply because those things don't overlap in my brain at all. Someone is either wholesome and appeals to the more innocent, romantic part of my brain, or they're someone who touches the lizard part of my brain and revs my engine, entirely an object of sexual desire. I can see how it was similar for folks who came from backgrounds that were ultimately very repressive and unhealthy about human sex and sexuality.

It's deeply unhealthy and unfortunate, and luckily I realized very early on it's a problem with my perception filtered through my own damage, not a true reflection of reality and how human connections should actually work. It could have been a lot worse in terms of being hateful, objectifying or outright misogynistic because I know it's my messed up brain and that I need to account for it when actually interacting with human beings.

AskMen,FruitPunchGorilla,1ns5alk,How do you guys gain and sustain motivation?,4,0,1,AutoModerator,ngjdbhu,"Here's an original copy of /u/FruitPunchGorilla's post (if available):

I'm someone who fell off from being the promising kid in high school, and wasted my bachelors degree years in isolation. No professional or personal growth. Never had a job, never had a partner. 23 next month, in education loan debt. Enrolled in a masters degree currently from a university that provides good opportunities but I just can't get the motivation to work hard for it.

I see my mates putting so much effort while also enjoying life, but I can't seem to get the hang of it. Part of it is because I feel if I sail along through my masters, I will get a semi-decent job and pay off my loan eventually. On one hand I feel life will be so much better if I grind now, on the other there is this feeling that life's not meant to be lived so seriously or competitively.

Anybody been in a similar spot?

I’ve wanted to post this for a while but keep going back and forth on how to word this to effectively ask:

Would you be interested in pursuing a long term relationship, eventually get married and starting a family at this stage? 

Background: it like I’ve spent my entire life studying, and dating has always been on the back burner. Im 36 now and have literally everything a woman could ever wish for and am generally happy in my life. I go to the gym, take care of myself and am always trying to better myself in every way. Additionally (Without sounding pompous, ) I’ve been told I’m easy on the eyes and get complimented often. I’m in a well paying medical field that has a lot of flexibility and do well financially. I have absolutely no drama in my life and am wondering if I’m just too closed off? 

The only thing missing in my life is a partner, but I’m at a loss for how to go about this, or if anyone would be interested in dating for the long term. It seems as though the men my age are already married or spoken for, or are perpetual bachelors, and don’t have interest in dating women my age (and prefer younger - which I completely understand)

Besides the age factor. What am I doing wrong, or is it naive to think that it could still happen for me at this stage of life, in this modern day dating environment where options are endless and my biological clock is ticking. I don’t seem to meet men anywhere besides work (200% off - limits and a hard red boundary for me)  so I want to ask men of Reddit generally - what are your views on women in my situation and stage of life? I’m happy to hear everyone’s answers - please don’t sugar coat and tell me straight as it is :)

Most decent, husband type dudes I know/knew that are single now have gone through the same thing. The majority of them are past starting a new family at this point. They might be down for marriage, I’m certainly not given the odds. 

Most dudes around 35 single, never married, no kids, either aren’t ever wanting to get married, or can and do attract women who don’t have as much time-pressure when it comes to marriage and family. That time pressure is a little stressful, dating is already stressful with all the stupid games. 

Another issue I see is that women who are successful think it makes them more desirable. It doesn’t. Nobody wants to date a woman who has absolutely no money, but having a lot doesn’t make her more desirable to him, unless he’s broke. 

Statistically men still pay for the majority of things in a relationship, so her money is of no benefit to him and doesn’t affect his attraction. Women care about money, are hypergamous, refuse to “date down” and if she makes 100k he’s got to make 100k+ too. That’s like 15% of the population.

I’m much more likely to entertain the idea of a relationship with someone I already know, and since I mind my own business at the gym, grocery store, bookstore, etc. and all my friends that are women are married, that most likely means someone at work would have to ask me out if we’re sharing a spark.

AskMen,anoyingprophet,1ns66ba,How do you deal with friends who ghost?,5,0,0,AutoModerator,ngjkd83,"Here's an original copy of /u/anoyingprophet's post (if available):

What’s the deal with homies who disappear from the squad and come back and act like nothings going on?

Quick mini anecdote.

Last night I was at one of my best friends weddings and it was an amazing time. Myself and the other grooms men and everyone’s gfs/wives who came all had a blast.

One thing that inspired this post is because one of my closest friends, who’s also a very close friend to the groom, just didn’t show up and has been dodging us and ghosting for the past few months.

Now this guy isn’t as close to the groom as the groomsmen, so that’s why he wasn’t one, but he’s still pretty damn tight with him and the rest of us. He will 100% be one of my groomsmen when I get married.

But what was odd is the dude just didn’t show, and he has these weird periods of his life where he completely ghosts all of us, disappears, and then he comes back and nobody says anything.

It’s clear to me that this guy has some mental health issues, specifically bouts of depression, but not showing up to this wedding really was a bit too far imo. Even his 2 brothers showed up and when I asked where he was, they said he’s just at home.

I’ve been trying to get in contact with this guy all summer, and he always has something going on, but I know it’s straight up BS because the guy doesn’t have a job at the moment as he just graduated school in the spring, and his brothers told me he’s just at home in his room.

I feel like this is a common character in friend group of most guys, and it shines a light on the male mental health crisis, and it’s something we need to do something about.

He’s not the first friend I’ve had who’s like this, and I just wish as men we were more thoughtful about these kinds of things and made more of an effort to address it rather than brush it off like it’s nothing.

One of my friends last night even said “don’t worry, he’s just going through another one of his isolation phases.”

This annoyed me because he was addressing this like it’s just part of his personality when there’s clearly a problem.

If this was him skipping out on us going to the movies or getting food, I wouldn’t care, but skipping his good friends wedding just stay in his bedroom, is an issue.

Have you guys ever dealt with this or had a friend like this?

How did you deal with it and what’s your advice?

SIDE-NOTE: this is something that’s really been bothering me because about 10 years ago when I was going through cancer treatment, this is the friend who would come over to my family’s home and spend time with me almost all day everyday and always made sure I was ok. I feel that I’m obliged to help him out too.

Trying to force your way in to help (if that’s what you wanna do) is gonna drive him away. Trying to force him to be around y’all when he’s in ghost mode is just gonna make him push away harder 🤷🏻‍♂️. He’s coming back, so he cares and that should be what matters right?",2,2025-09-27,20:22:49

Ask him about it. *Communicate*

One of my best friends is hella depressed, often, and has to take breaks from the world regularly and become an absolute hermit at times for his mental health.

But after years of being friends we have become great at communicating that.

I know not to take it to heart when he is less good at responsive. I know hell tell me if things are really bad or just a usual level of bad. I understand that for his own mental health, he just has to hide away from the world for a week to a month or two at a time sometimes. 

Often times he will tell me if I try to plan something that he doesn't have the energy and gives me an approximate timeframe before he feels he will be up to it.

Having that sort of communication really takes the wondering out of it. Takes away any feelings I have of being in the dark or rejected or concern for him. Puts it back onto what's important, him managing his own mental health is no reflection on me or our friendship.

So yeah, you said no one says anything when he comes back, maybe you should, communicate with him, from a place of concern.

For context, i’m someone who always wanted to change, dress, smell and appearance better but whatever i was too lazy to do anything.

I promised myself i would when I entered university because people are so much nicer and its easier to start fresh. But i got kinda lazy again.

Now a month in, and I love it so far but I’m honestly still wanting to change. I just barely ever confident in the way that I look rn, usally wear the same old fit every single day and i never bother to change or style anything.

So I finally bought some new clothes, cologne, hair products and I’m ready to change.

For me a big part is the confidence, I genuinely feel so much better when the style just hirs and it makes me feel more confident as someone whos not crazy buff or outgoing, even tho I am actively working on improving both those things. Plus theres this girl I like and this feels like the first step to at least getting to know/make a good impression.

Even tho I go to a moderately sized uni, I keep thinking people might find it weird that I changed or smell better or etc. i’m sure no one would care but am i worrying too much about this?

Choose to, at least, guide the change in a way that makes you happier.  Or don't.   And change while you can,  before life starts putting you into positions where you won't have as much flexibility, as in, poor  health, aging, life responsibilities.


Anyways, it's uni, you won't see these people ever again in a few years, truly.  If you think you will, consider when everyone has kids and relationships the whole idea of life changes, people fall off, hard.  Don't let social media connections trick you into thinking these are real connections for the most part either.

A little background info:

Me like coworker I work with,  I ask coworker for #, we talk for a bit, I let her know my true intentions because its not right to pretend to be her friend, she says she respects that I was honest and that she's talking to someone so it's a no, I understand and stop texting her as much, I notice that her responses were dry so I understood I shouldn't text her anymore about anything. 

Fast forward she texts me about work I reply like a fun coworker trying to respect her talking stage. We talk for a bit but her responses take days even though she texted 1st. I ask if she ok, she says she was busy, (I didn't truly believe that) so I text back dry. 

Later on I text  about something after work, she responds, we talk for a bit, we vibing then suddenly no response for 4 days! I seen her active on other social media. I don't text again bc 1st time I double texted was to see if she was okay. Now I feel stuck and embarrassed. I have to see them tmr. I feel like such a fool.

Also, in my experience, women 100% of the time provide approximately 0 stability and contribute an absolute minimum of 40% of the chaos in a man's life, the usual being about 80%.

I've never heard of a man looking for ""stability"" in a woman. I thought we'd all accepted that that's not a thing by now lolll

Unless he's specifically looking for a roommate to help pay his bills, I have no clue what ""stability"" is for a man's relationship with a woman.

AskMen,SheikhAmmar,1ns0pja,Why do I feel sexually attracted to my friend’s family just because he mentions them?,9,0,0,AutoModerator,ngidmwq,"Here's an original copy of /u/SheikhAmmar's post (if available):

Why do I feel sexual desire toward my friend’s family (his sisters and sometimes even his mother) whenever he casually mentions them? For example, if he says something like “My mom cooked this dish yesterday” or “My sister is studying for her exams,” I suddenly start feeling attracted to them — even though I’ve never met them in person.

It’s starting to affect me in real life. I find it hard to build new relationships because these thoughts keep coming back. Sometimes I even go on his Facebook profile and scroll, trying to find pictures of his sister. If she looks more “open” or outgoing, my desire gets stronger, but even if she doesn’t, the desire never completely goes away.

I don’t understand where this is coming from. It doesn’t seem logical — the situations he mentions are totally normal and non-sexual. Yet, just the fact that he brings them up triggers this reaction in me. Has anyone experienced something like this? What could explain why this happens?

I (19m) started university last year and to be honest without sounding weird it genuinely has been like heaven to me because everyday on campus i see chubby girls which makes my heart flutter a bit. Unfortunately, i lack the courage to actually talk to them, which is something im working on :/

When i was in school there were mainly girls of a normal more conventionally attractive body type which didn’t do much for me, unlike my friends

The reason im asking is because i feel different to other guys my age who are head over heels for more slim, conventionally attractive women, but im more into the heavier women and i just don’t know why that is.

At the end of the day i guess it doesn’t really matter but i am curious as to where this attraction comes from and why it differs from more traditional heteronormative attraction 

I guess to add, how do i go about actually approaching these girls??? Considering that i tend to freeze when talking to pretty women

*by chubbier i mean kinda overweight not morbidly obese 

*for reference i mean women like adele or ashley graham hahahaha 

*if it means anything i workout often and have a lean physique too

For instance, reproductive rights is regularly touted as men taking from women, whereas you’ll find anti-abortion individuals are far more split among gender. The people I’ve actually had complex conversations with where I tried to explain my pro abortion stance were actually mothers, but people like to tout how it’s all men and men shouldn’t have a voice in these issues. They are, as it turns out, -human- issues and should be represented as such.

> A stop to the demonization (or even any moral characteristic) to masculinity. The only time masculinity has been brought up around me by feminists was either to describe “toxic masculinity” or to praise what they considered  to be the “right” type of masculinity. In the same way that women should have the peace to represent their femininity freely, we need to stop this bullshit where men are evaluated either by the things they do wrong or the things they give to women. We are men, we will decide our values.

> an understanding that feminism itself is a tool for specific social/political issues and IS NOT a one-size-fits-all solution to our (or every) society. No, not everyone needs to be feminist to be a good person. It needs to be an actual movement, not be a self descriptor test for who you afford time to listen to or reject.

> An even handed understanding that the genders can often be (but not always by individual) very very different, and that the needs of boys are not always the same as girls. Got raised by a home that practically had no testosterone in it, and god if I’m not reaping the consequences of that lack of male understanding, and the “feminism” I was raised by. “We are not defective women,” etc.

> patience when dealing with those who struggle to understand a female issues, and an openness to trying to understand why people’s world views or experiences make them distrustful of women in the same way that traumatized women have a decent reason to be distrustful of men. In fact, just a general acknowledgement that women as a gender are not more (or less) trustworthy than men, and that women can be an extremely dangerous presence to men.

> being quick to go after and denounce radfems and people who think men should die, misandrists, etc. NOT just saying “well those aren’t ‘real’ feminists” when someone explains the misandry they’ve experience.

Basically, support is so that we can support you. Meet some people in the middle. Stop coming up with quick useless phrases just to denounce people who have disagreements (“equality looks like oppression…”, “‘meet me in the middle says the unjust man…”)

Also, empathizing with young men to give them an alternative to the manosphere, which really negatively impacts men’s mental health and creates negative views of women, should be seen as the highest priority item, yet I rarelt see anywhere other than the manosphere showing any olive branches of empathy or attempts to understand the underlying issues that lead disaffected men into those more radicalized spaces.

There is too much pandering and too much intellectual dishonesty because everyone has to say something positive about women any time anything about an issue surrounding men is discussed. It feels like men aren’t really allowed to point out obvious bias or logical flaws in certain near consensus feminist views without multiple reaffirming statements about other views.

Some basic rebranding would help. I would start calling it gender equality. Men would probably have an easier time accepting “toxic masculinity” if it was rebranded as “unfair double standards and expectations on men that they can’t possibly live up to and lead them to anger” because that is basically what the concept is.

I make it a core message and value that it is impossible to know which gender has it worse as a whole, and trying to determine who has it worse as a whole doesn’t really matter. People of both genders have negative impacts of gender expectations and norms, and the impacts in specific areas on specific people is more important.

If I’m just feeling a little frisky I’ll ask him what his meeting schedule is for the day and he gets the hint that I want dick, but it can wait until he’s less busy. 

If I’m feeling frisky frisky I ask him if he has time for me soon. Usually, that gets me some dick within the hour. 

If I’m feeling **FRISKY** I say, “I need to get off, you in or out?”. That means if he can’t make himself available within the next 15mins, I’m going to go do it by myself lol. 

The entirety of our nearly 17 year relationship I’m the one to initiate sex 99% of the time. My sex drive is higher than his.

AskWomen,Rich-Mix2273,1nrj9pg,What do you adore about your best friend(s)?,60,0,59,centre_red_line33,ngf5jt2,"Let me tell you about my best friend. We met 11 years ago on the internet because I bought a pair of discontinued leggings from her in a B/S/S group. We had both sought them out for our respective trips to Ireland. We kept in touch after that and a few years later she coincidentally moved a few hours away from me about 7 years ago so we met for the first time. We both moved away within 2 years. 

We’re both now childless cat ladies in our 30s. I can count on two hands the number of times I have seen my best friend in person. We don’t talk every day. But I can say without a doubt that this is the most important person in my life. 

Twice now (in one year, no less) I’ve told her that I would be performing in my pole dance studio’s showcase. This isn’t a major competition or a big stage; this is dancing in a room for 50 people. Without prompting, without question, she has said “and I will be there.” She flew across the country to watch me dance for 5 minutes, twice. And she cried with joy for me both times. 

She is my biggest supporter, the ultimate hype woman. She knows my biggest hurts and deepest insecurities and even though she is far away from me, I know that no matter what she is right there by my side, cheering me on. 

Im crying right now writing this because I’ve never felt so loved and supported by anyone. Not parents, not partners. No one else has ever made me feel like I deserved it. 

I love you, K.",18,2025-09-27,00:10:59

Very independent and resilient, posses dry wit, and impeccable taste, she likes what she likes with no self doubt, however she is open to new experiences. She knows her limits and sticks to whatever boundaries she has drawn in terms of relationships, work life balance, etc.
She's also very reserved and takes forever to open up. Being her friend and having her confidence is a gift.
We've been there for eachother through each of own mental health struggles and we mesh super well together. We're both pretty introverted. Some of my favourite memories I have growing up are eating sandwiches after school and reading Archie comics together. Her mom would tease us because we weren't interacting with eachother. She's one of the few people in my life I've always found a sense of peace around and while we have great conversations were happy to ""interact"" without talking💙

Today, I feel truly blessed to have the two who remain, both anchoring my life in different yet equally meaningful ways:

- Childhood friend: She has seen me at my best and at my absolute worst, yet with her I am always my truest self. Around her, I can completely let go, almost “brainless” in the best way because her presence makes me feel safe and at peace. Hard to explain how special she is.

Though we work in different professions and have different interests, our conversations flow effortlessly. Time with her feels like stepping into another universe, filled with endless hee hee ha ha.

If there is anyone I trust more than myself, it’s her.

- My high school friend is like a mirror in many ways. We’ve often been the misunderstood pretty women all our lives. This kind of struggle per se is very difficult to explain to someone who never been through.

Beneath that surface, we are funny, non-competitive, supportive women who simply work hard for the finer things in life. 

We share an almost paradoxical mix: we may look “vain,” but we’re deeply nerdy at heart. From legal writing to SQL code, she values the things I love and share my genuine excitement for knowledge. 

I deeply respect her journey and her strength. Her acknowledgement and understanding mean a lot to me. And I very much feel seen by her.",2,2025-09-27,04:43:35

People might think I am crazy, but I believe God gave her to me. She was new in our school, and we had class together. We did not really talk much. I could see she was in a rough patch. A few months went by and I went to church, and there she was, sitting by herself. I went and sat next to her. From there we talk almost every day. 

She lost her baby when we where 22. Her boy was 14 months old. It almost broke her. The strength she had to get up and live is commendable. I would not have been able to do the same.

Another is someone who I grew up with. Similar tastes. We can tell each other anything. Also the communication is just perfect.

My oldest child died when she was 6. 

My middle child was kidnapped by her dad and stepmother. I haven't seen her or heard from her in a couple of years. 

Took me years and years to recover from that trauma, get married, and had a surprise geriatric pregnancy while on birth control. 

My very handsome surprise baby has a critical congenital health issue and I already can't get health insurance so I live in a fucking camper after selling my home to keep my child alive when he was born. Actually, I sold 4 homes in total. I don't have another house to sell, so I'm not sure how to keep my child alive on any given day, let alone if something goes wrong and he needs a hospital stay, or even a regular checkup, because those are all specialists due to his condition. 

Live with that stress, worry, grief, and guilt for an hour, and then go ahead and make some dumbass statement like that to me. 

Motherhood has not been kind to me. 

I feel like we are cursed. Doomed. I don't want to get old if it means I have to bury all of my children. I dont know what's going on with my middle child, and I may never get answers to that. Even if we reconnect, who am I getting back? What if she's not safe? What if I have to send her away? 

See? It's a lot of effort to just not go off on the numerous people who say that to me. I've just started turning and walking away because I can't say that shit out loud.

AskMen,kits_and_kaboodle,1nthuag,“Guys: who usually disposes of the condom after sex in your experience?,317,0,654,AutoModerator,ngtnns2,"Here's an original copy of /u/kits_and_kaboodle's post (if available):

After protected sex, who usually takes care of the condom in your experience: you, her, or does it vary?

For me, it’s almost always been me. But on a recent date, my partner helped with withdrawal and then took the condom to the bathroom herself. It struck me as considerate and kind of surprising. Later, though, I noticed a flicker of paranoia — like, what if she didn’t actually throw it out? Even though I know that doesn’t really make sense (she has an IUD, is pro-choice, and already has a child). I chalk it up to my brain being in a vulnerable place.

That same night, I also had a non-ejaculatory orgasm before my usual climax — a first for me with a partner. She was really sweet about it, which made me reflect on how partners respond when something unusual or surprising happens in bed.

So I’m curious:
– Who usually handles condom disposal in your experience?
– Do you ever get odd post-sex thoughts or flickers of paranoia?
– How do you or your partners respond when something unexpected happens?

In Michigan a woman spat out the sperm and inserted it into herself resulting in pregnancy.

PSA to please google condoms, sexual safety, and sperm lifespans before you start relying on them! It’s never a good idea to use any tool if you don’t truly understand it.

Tons of condom brands contain spermicide in them (nearly all that I know of, but I don’t have true percentages offhand). The spermicide is usually the lubricant on the outside of the condom, so your partner comes into contact with it first thing. It kills sperm pretty instantaneously. 

And on top of that, sperm has a lifespan of minutes once it’s exposed to air / oxygen. Between the air contact as soon as you remove it, and the spermicide inside your partner, the odds of pregnancy are _extremely_ low, even if your partner attempts to sabotage after the fact.

But frankly, don’t sleep with anyone who gives you this anxiety. If it’s a serious concern for you regardless of partner, then make sure you’re ejaculating responsibly. Don’t leave big life choices in the hands of others. The vast majority of women are hyper focused on _preventing_ pregnancy, not sneakily causing an 18+ year saga of court drama with a reluctant father lmao. Sure, there’s some that exist, but they’re usually not the women using condoms with a new partner.",2,2025-09-29,15:02:53

the odds are low but there's still a chance of it happening and the law is very anti-male with this. Although I guess I'm taking the same risk of not using a condom with my partner on birth control. Also some condoms I think have spermicide added so maybe it kills the sperm anyway?

A lot of people talk about she doesn't hate men or act like any guy she dates is already the villain and has to jump through hoops to prove he is 'different', which is a pretty obvious green flag when you're a man.

Every woman I've been acquainted with who turned that on women and insisted she wasn't 'like other girls' or insisted she could only he friends with guys because women were 'too dramatic' or whatever, it always turned out they were the dramatic ones. You know how they say, ""If it smells like shit everywhere you go, check your own shoe?"" It applies double in romantic relationships.

m not just talking about not-cheating, that should be obvious, but something more and deeper.

My cousin has a wife like that, and she had this Green Flag since they started dating:

\- she herself set hard boundaries with other men when she started dating him. No flirting, no double-entendre jokes etc

\- AFAIK, she never talked bad about him, either behind his back or publicly to his face

\- never talks smack about him to her friends, not even i the ""men, heh?"" kind of a way. She always glazes him in front of others

Probably the best example of what I mean was when we were all out partying, and some other guy tried his moves on her. She absolutley brushed him off, but the dude would not give up, and acted more and more like an ass with every minute, either trying to impress her or belittle her husband. Finally the guy got fed up and shot a passive aggressive: ""So, what does your hubbie got that you think I don't?!""

Her straight-up deadpan answer, loud enough for all the room to hear: ""Lots of things, but mostly his huge, HUGE cock.""",44,2025-09-29,05:39:52

Recently I was told it was “gross” and “unladylike” to do this at home with my partner present. We’ve been together for 2 years. 

It’s not obnoxious either, just like the occasional burp (covered mouth, not louder than it should be). Mentioning that I have a “stomach ache” and to avoid the room, etc. 

I guess I’m just at that point (and age as I’m 31 and he is 36) where I thought we were past acting like women don’t have gastrointestinal symptoms.

AskMen,5amscrolling,1nt90cj,What is your opinion on your female partner belching or passing gas at home?,182,0,248,ChevalierMal_Fet,ngv1znl,"This is one of those things where I think the overall context *really* makes a difference.

My ex-wife basically had no sense of shame. She'd burb with her mouth open at me, she'd pick her teeth at the table, and when she felt the need to fart, she'd let it rip wherever. While I totally get that these are all things that we do *sometimes*, the problem became the fact that it was constant and she made no effort whatsoever to be polite or mannered. It started to feel less like her being comfortable and more like her just not giving a shit (in the overall context of everything else in the relationship).

Speaking for myself personally, I don't care if the person I'm seeing farts near me- we're all humans. The thing that becomes problematic for me is when the person seems to become so comfortable in the relationship that they just stop trying and stop putting forth an effort to maintain the relationship.

With my current partner, I feel like we do a better job of just being respectful towards each other. We don't try to gross each other out or whatever, and it's nice because it feels like I'm dating an adult. Things still happen- once while we were on the couch cuddling and drinking sparkling water, I accidentally burped in her ear- I apologized profusely and she laughed it off because *of course that would happen*, and it's not like I was just being crass. She also recognized that I was a little embarrassed and didn't make a big deal about it one way or the other, which was nice. Likewise, there have been some other things that have happened where she gave me a mortified look and I just said, ""Eh, it happens"" and carried on as if it hadn't.

And things do happen, but I think the difference is that we're actively trying to remain attractive to the other person. I think it's important to be comfortable with your partner, but I think it's also important to make sure that comfort doesn't slip into carelessness, because I think that's when partners begin to stop perceiving each other as ""romantic partners"" and start seeing each other more as ""roommates."" My girlfriend and I both experienced this (her with her ex-boyfriend and me with my ex-wife). 

I *want* her to be attracted to me, so I put in the effort to be attractive to her- I stay in shape, I practice good table manners, and I stay clean shaven. She wants me to be attracted to her, so she puts in the effort to be attractive to me as well. And that is comfortable as well. It's less easy and it's more work, but it's comforting knowing that we are both actively engaged in trying to be our best for each other.",3,2025-09-29,14:31:52

Story time- I have a vivid memory from an age I can’t remember but fairly early memory nonetheless. Farting loudly to elicit laughter from friends had just become a thing and I did it to make my dad laugh. He didn’t find it funny and told me, “that’s not funny”. I also have another separate memory from my grandpa commenting that smelling a fart is literally inhaling poop particles which medically speaking is kinda close to the truth.

Having spent my adult life in very male dominated environments farting loudly and even publicly is still funny. But I don’t do it because of the aforementioned experiences. 

I see videos online depicting farting or discussing bowel movements as a barometer of how close you are to your partner and it’s just not for me. If I was dating girl and she made a show of farting or belching, no go. But I also don’t expect her to hold in normal body functions to a point of discomfort. 

My point of view: farting or belching loudly on purpose is gross. But passing gas or belching is not unladylike given normal body functions. If your partner is unbothered, live your life. If he has a preference I think it’s relevant, if reciprocated.",2,2025-09-29,16:57:12

Guys and girls think differently and have different priorities. For my wife, any number of inconveniences are absolutely reason enough not to have sex. Headache? No sex. Stressful day? No sex. Tired? No sex. Angry? No sex. 

For me, sex is literally the fix for all of those issues. Headache? Sexxxx. Stressful day? Get that dopamine!! Tired? Nest sleep ever... After sex. Angry? Angry sex baby!! 

Especially in my younger years, there was almost nothing that would cause me to say no to sex. She could find me bleeding to death on a car wreck and ask me if I wanted sex and ide be like... ""The best way to die... Let's get it on."" 

So, what's the issue? Well the issue is both of us not understanding each other's views and expecting each other to see things the same as us. So for me, none of the reasons she gave me would ever stop me from having sex, so that means I don't hear ""My head hurts."" I hear ""I don't want you."" Now guys aren't complete idiots and we get told no a lot so a few times in a row and it hurts but we expect it. But after a solid three weeks, you feel undesired, unwanted, and unloved. Now I don't make excuses for cheating but I'll tell ya, when a man has been made to feel unwanted for a few months in a row... When a coworker whispers in his ear, ""I want you."" The best men are going to struggle not to break. All that said, I also needed to understand my wife's perspective. Took a while , but things are going a hell of a lot better in our relationship now. 

A few times a week still hurt, but any guy who understands women at all, isn't going to take it personally. Make it go on for a few months, you're ending your own relationship.",3,2025-09-29,14:13:30

There's times when either of you will not sync up with the other one and you don't just do it anyway but you also recognize each other's needs as important enough to be significant but not over rule your own will & limits.

If it's ongoing, then you all need to start communicating better and take the time to get in touch with your feelings before it just comes out in resentment.

If some man child pouts every time he can't stick it in a hole to relieve himself, give him some lube and a fleshlight.",2,2025-09-29,15:22:05

If it's not, something is wrong, and it's time to work like a couple on fixing it.

In a previous ‘ship, I was told by my ex-partner they weren’t really sexually attracted to me and they would still have sex with me occasionally (we were non-monogamous); but for the most part it felt like a “yes to that, no to you” much of the time as they had three other sexual partners/intimate friends they were having sex with more frequently, or so I thought. I became pushy after one of the “no’s” was during a time that was rough on both of us; and couldn’t see my anxiety/insecurities being the reason why they said “no” as I was badgering and such. That ‘ship didn’t last for very long after that. I became very anxious that my partner wasn’t fully into me and insecure about my place amongst her relationships; and yeah, that realization came from analyzing my childhood.

Nowadays, after a couple years of therapy, I don’t get so anxious about my self-worth or if my current partner doesn’t want to have it. I trust that when they say no, it’s nothing personal. We have had much better sex when it’s not pressured (I learned about a term called “maintenance sex” which changed a lot about how I approach bids for it) and initiating on either side has been relatively equal. I can trust their “hell yes” as much as their “no”.",1,2025-09-29,15:19:47

The key part here is communication. Her not feeling depends also. Just not in the mood? Oh well, that's life. Is she mad at me? I should find out why so she's not mad (happy spouse happy house).


Medical related? My wife had a surgery and I'll tell you what for 3 months sex wasn't even on my mind except for when she voiced that she felt bad about it after a couple weeks. I literally didn't care. Her recovery was supposed to (and did) take a couple months but I just wrote off 3-4 just in case. I was still affectionate though, cause you know, common sense.

Where it gets iffy is a difference in libido. But that should be something that's sorted early in the relationship. Unless it's a change later down the road. In which case communication/therapy/doctors check up is in order.

For me it’s being able to burn CDs and make custom labels for them. I remember spending hours picking the right songs and putting them in the perfect order and then printing out these little cover artworks. Totally pointless now when I can just hit shuffle on spotify. The funny thing is I was thinking about it last night while I was playing a few matches of rocket league and it just hit me how much time I used to put into that. Like no one ever asks for a custom CD anymore but I’m still proud I know how to do it.

It got me wondering what other random “useless” skills people are still hanging on to. Stuff that doesn’t really matter anymore but you can’t help but feel proud you learned it.

What’s yours?

Not talking about vacations or big milestones but the little daily things that keep you sane.

AskMen,Dangerous-Pattern142,1nt9so4,How did you stop drinking?,79,0,86,AutoModerator,ngs4jq3,"Here's an original copy of /u/Dangerous-Pattern142's post (if available):

I'm 26 years old m. I've been drinking consistently for about 5 years now (since 21{context: started drinking when I was 15}). As I type this I have drank 10 topo Chico hard seltzers and will doubtless finish the 12 pack I bought just several hours ago. 

I do want to stop, but every time I try I shake or become depressed.

My current routine is as follows: I wake up at about 7am, go to work, shake aggressively for the first 2 or so hours (I've offset this with more quick and fluid motions that hide the shaking from my coworkers). The midday is normal, but come evening and I am feinding for any sort of drink. I'll drink a 12 pack, half a 750ml of Tito's or a whole 750ml of disarono, and the thing is that I won't even blackout or feel drunk.

 I've done the aforementioned drinking and maintained memory and coherence.

I want to stop but I help run a small company and if I don't drink the shaking and memory issues I experience become severe and I can't maintain productivity. 

I used to say I was sad or depressed, but lately I feel nothing and I am scared. I fulfill obligations out of habit alone but do not care.

I suppose, I ask, if you have been in my situation, what did you do? How can I cut back? How can I stop?

AskMen,Dangerous-Pattern142,1nt9so4,How did you stop drinking?,79,0,86,TheTolietWhoSpeaks,ngs8chm,"Hey buddy

Some of the comments are a little harsh, but I’m a nurse and I work in detox from people withdrawing from all sorts drugs all the time (mainly alcohol) so I thought I’d chime in. 

It sounds like you were trying to use alcohol to help soften those hard emotions you were/are experiencing and I can understand why you may have put yourself in that circumstance. You’re probably a little spooked but trust me buddy, it’s all gonna work out. 

Like some of the others said, the best thing to do is to get yourself checked into a hospital and start your detox. If you’re at the point you’re shaking and getting physical symptoms from not having a drink, this is bar none the safest thing to do. You can seize and cause yourself brain damage if you try to do this alone in your basement. 

Secondly, when you’re done with your detox, you want to preferably check into some sort of residential rehab (Typically 30 or 90 days). A lot of people think they can just walk out the hospital whistling dixie and think they’ll never drink again. No. Be smart. Check in. 

Rehab (a good one at least) will provide you with meds to keep you stable and counseling groups for you to learn coping skills to not drink again. 

I cannot emphasize enough. The coping skills are huge. Therapy is huge. The people who succeed the longest, are the most self aware, the quickest to surrender their ego and the quickest to call themselves out on their bullshit. Don’t rush out of rehab. Bathe in it. Learn it. Get your mind right before you get back out there. This is how you recover 

If you treat the process like “I just need the right meds” the whole time, thinking it’s going to provide you the same feeling alcohol did, you will fuck yourself and your recovery. You will be more anxious, depressed and miserable than usual. But this is just the beginning. You will get better. Your mood will improve. And it only get better from there.

No you can’t drink again. Not even once. Not a shot. Not a beer. Not a drop

You’re 26 man. You got so much time and you can be an inspiration to yourself and others. You can put the bottle away for good and still live an enriching and beautiful life. But hear me

Trust the process. Keep going. And you’ll get there",145,2025-09-29,02:59:20

She put on some weight but was finally able to quit the alcohol and then focus on cutting down on the sugar and having a more healthy balanced diet. 


You’re definitely an alcoholic and it’s great that you’ve realised that.

2½ years ago I was 10 months from being 60, huge beer belly and struggling with most things except drinking. Usually a 6 pack of beer and then 1 to 3 bottles of wine every night - this was on my own, mostly at home. 

I decided I didn't want to hit my 60s in that shape so decided to stop drinking for 2 weeks, just to prove to myself I could. I still haven't had a drink. For the first year I would tell people I was having a couple of weeks off, but would be back on the booze soon. I also started walking 3 miles every day

I had 2 beers in my fridge and 2 bottles of good red wine from before I stopped. I had told myself that those 2 beers would be the first drink I would have when I started again. So they were the only drinks I had to worry about, if I was out, they weren't there, so I would have to wait until I got home. Those beers & wine stayed there until a couple of months ago when my son was visiting and I have them to him as I didn't need the crutch anymore. 

I have lost over 25% of my drinking body weight, I am moderately toned and physically fit. I dropped from 36""waist jeans to 30"", have ended up with a great wardrobe and I look (& feel) younger than I have for 20 years. My head is clear and I don't miss it one but

Alcohol is a depressor, this is no surprise, your neural connections have modified theselves to function at baseline state with the depressor, your brain has modified itself to work within the new conditions as normal.

You shake because without the depressor the neurons are firing too much, as they have modified themselves to function with alcohol, some of these trigger motor actions; but o course neurons encode more than motor actions, so you may feel anxiety as well, things that are not real per say, they are reality, because neurons dictate how you feel and act.

Physical dependance like this requires drug intervention, to slowly turn back the neurons back to their usual, and you can't quit cold turkey; it takes a method, the method depends on many things, your weight, your age, existing conditions, interaction with other drugs, etc...

If you have nothing else but physical dependance adquired from say, excessive partying or our of habit; a simple doctor would be enough, potentially even a simple neurologist, pretty sure they know about physical dependance and how it affects neurons; that saying, addiction medicine is something different, because there are often other factors more than just physical dependance, it is rare someone gets physical dependance without underlying psychological issues, needing consueling.",1,2025-09-29,02:35:20

I quit for like 9 months but am back on. What helped me quit was to make sure my evenings were packed with stuff so that I did not have the time or energy to drink. Family and kids took up a lot of time, but once they are asleep is when I would drink.

The best advice I have for quitting sounds obvious and not worth saying, but stop drinking. Stop going to the places you usually drink at, stop talking to the people you usually drink with, stop doing the things you associate with drinking. Quitting drinking needs to go along with a lifestyle change or it won't stick. Find things to replace the drinking with

As others have said, detox can be dangerous. Speak to a doctor before you just quit cold turkey. They have medications they can give you to help with the withdrawal and they might even suggest detoxing in a facility where you're weaned off of alcohol in a controlled way so it's safe.

No matter how you do this, be prepared. It's going to suck donkey balls and there's no way around it. Withdrawal sucks, redesigning your life sucks. All of early sobriety sucks and you just have to weather the storm and get out on the other side. It does get better though. Stick with it and you will reap the rewards.",1,2025-09-29,06:14:27

I think it would surprise most of the people that interact with me.  It’s mostly genetic, both of my parents were heavy drinkers.  My mom would knock out a twelve pack every couple of days and my dad would knock out a twelve pack a day and was, with some strings attached, a functioning alcoholic.  The closest to the precipice I got was the six months after my mom’s death.  I used alcohol to blunt the memories from doing her CPR.  At that point, I was killing a bottle of liquor every weekend.  

In my case, I don’t really enjoy being intoxicated that much.  I’m surrounded by alcohol.  I have 27 bottles of liquor, five bottles of wine, and like eight different beers/low alcohol content drinks.  I find that the more surrounded I am, the more it’s just a fixture of my environment.  

I’m not actively quitting or anything, by the way.  I’ll take a double of Drambuie or have a Not Your Father’s root beer here and there, but I don’t really keep track of those either.

AskMen,Dangerous-Pattern142,1nt9so4,How did you stop drinking?,79,0,86,sludgeandfudge,ngwjjmx,"Here’s what worked for me. For context I started drinking ~16yo but didn’t consider myself an alcoholic until 22yo and didn’t get sober until 33yo

I grew up watching my parents crack open wine or pour cocktails every single day at 5pm. I never saw them get drunk, but like clockwork they always had drinks in the evening

In college, I started taking adderall to study all night and cram. Problem was I could never sleep after taking adderall and discovered that alcohol was great at taking the edge off enough so I could sleep

I’ve had issues with a racing mind and not being able to sleep my whole life (typically laying in bed for 1-2 hours with thoughts racing unable to fall asleep)

This was a terrible realization because I then started using alcohol to take the edge off enough to fall asleep quickly and it was panacea to my issue

Fast forward to graduation and I’m out of school, $200k in student loans with $1500/month payments, no clue what I want to do career wise, just broken up with and miserable. No sense of control over my life. But alcohol helps me sleep, it can help me subdue my emotions and stop thinking so much about my situation. My parents drank every day and they didn’t have issues so it’s no big deal. I’m not an alcoholic cuz I’m using it as a tool, not for fun…

Next 10 years my tolerance goes up, I never address underlying issues in life because I have my perfect coping mechanism in alcohol and getting drunk so I don’t have to think about things. I’m finishing a plastic handle of whiskey ever 3-4 days and don’t even mix or chase anymore, just pull straight from the bottle. I’m now in the worst shape of my life, 50lbs overweight, miserable all the time but at this point I’ve accepted that I’ll eventually die from alcoholism. I’m okay with that, I don’t want to exist anyway and this gives me plausible deniability I wouldn’t get if I were to off myself. I have zero confidence or self image, the only way I can measure myself positively is through my job but I have terrible imposter syndrome

Miraculously, some things happen that change the context for everything. A buddy helps me get a raise, and it’s way easier than I expected. My boss is happy to do it because I’m a good employee. Huh, maybe I’m not as big of a piece of shit as I thought. But my health is getting worse. I’ve grown a titty (I’m a male) due to massive hormone imbalances because I’ve been drinking so much for so long. I start getting treatment for that with my doctor but nothing is working because I haven’t mentioned the cause. 

I’ve started looking at the subreddit r/stopdrinking at this point. I want to control my alcohol intake. Why I think I can do this I don’t know. But after perusing those forums for a few weeks I come to the realization that I have to stop completely and utterly. I won’t ever be able to toast champagne or take shots with friends, no first beer with a future son, etc. I kick this around in my head for a while before I accept everything I wouldn’t be able to do. 

I’ve been seeing my doctor for my hormone issue for a while now. He is incredibly kind and compassionate and I actually feel comfortable broaching the topic of alcoholism and lay everything out there. He helps me put a plan together that includes alcohol cessation medication and anti seizure medication. I find an extended weekend to finally rip the bandaid off. I tell my family I’m not drinking for a bit to see if there’s any health benefits, I tell no one I’m an alcoholic except my doctor. 

Thanks to the medications I am actually able to go to sleep sober for the first time in a decade. I am fully committed to never drinking again, this isn’t that hard. The excitement of not drinking fades after a week and I am counting the passage of time by the second. I need to distract myself so I start walking whenever I am not working. This eventually leads to me starting a running program. I start running all the time and sign up for a 5k. Running helps with distraction immensely. 

The next 12 months I suffer miserably from post acute withdrawal syndrome. This was hell but absolutely reinforced that I can never go through this experience again. 

Fast forward to now, 2.5 years sober from alcohol. Best shape of my life, excelled in my career, but still plenty of work to do. But I know that alcohol will not help with any of this and I hold strong",1,2025-09-29,18:50:49
AskMen,Dangerous-Pattern142,1nt9so4,How did you stop drinking?,79,0,86,SoggyMountain956,ngwk4m2,"Brother I've been there. I remember asking the same questions 15 years ago. I can't tell YOU how YOU can get sober but I can tell you what worked for me.

Before I do let me qualify myself a little bit. Towards the end of my drinking career I was shooting out of bed around 4-5 am after passing out only a few hours before. My heart would be racing and I had so much anxiety. I never got the shakes because I couldn't let withdrawal last that long without taking another drink. So I'd immediately take a swig of straight vodka and try to keep it down with yakking so my heart would calm down. 2-3 shots always while the coffee was still brewing. I was good after that. I could slowly drink some strong IPAs all day if I wasn't doing anything until bedtime when I passed out again. If I had to work, I kept a bottle of vodka under the front seat of my car and would take a swig every hour or so. I was pretty good at flat lining but every once in a while I would lose control and black out.

I did all this while being in a long term relationship and living with my partner who had no idea. She just thought I liked to drink beer. She didn't see the vodka. I was in sales and was #1 in my company. On the outside everything looked out together. But I knew I was going to kill myself. I knew I was killing myself. And I didn't want to die young...

So I went to a professional detox and it saved my life. They were able to medically withdraw ne safely, while monitoring my blood pressure and giving my comfort meds to make it as painless as possible. It wasnt fun but i couldn't do it on my own.i had tried. And tried. And tried. For three years. I had to remove myself from being able to physically access alcohol. Call it weak minded but I call it addiction. 

Detox broke the physical addiction but without something else to fill the void I was bound to relapse. It had happened before. And you have several options here. Some go to church. Some get ""California sober"" and some , like me, go to a 12 step fellowship. 

I'm coming up on 3 years without a drink and my life is completely different and so so so much better than I ever thought it would/could be. Do yourself a favor and just start dialing numbers to detox clinics. You owe it to yourself to get better. It can get better. It will get better.

AskMen,photo_inbloom,1ntb6s0,What goes on inside your head when you actually have feelings for a girl?,69,0,68,Brightest_Idiot,ngspb6t,"Not the answer you're looking for but here you go:


1. Key Neurotransmitters and Hormones


​Dopamine (The ""Feel-Good"" Neurotransmitter):


​This is the star of the show, heavily involved in the brain's reward system.
​When you see, hear from, or think about the girl, dopamine levels surge, creating intense feelings of euphoria, pleasure, and motivation—similar to a natural ""high.""
​This surge reinforces the desire to seek out and spend time with that person, making the experience highly addictive.


​Norepinephrine (Adrenaline's Cousin):


​Also known as noradrenaline, this is responsible for the physical signs of attraction, like a racing heart, sweaty palms, flushed cheeks, and the feeling of ""butterflies"" in your stomach.
​It contributes to the energy and excitement of new love.


​Serotonin (The Mood Regulator):


​Interestingly, serotonin levels often drop in the early stages of intense love.
​This lower level of serotonin is associated with obsessive thinking about the person, similar to what is seen in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which can make the girl feel all-consuming in your thoughts.


​Oxytocin (The ""Bonding"" or ""Love Hormone""):


​While more prominent in the later stages of attachment, oxytocin is released during physical intimacy like hugging, kissing, and other skin-to-skin contact.
​It promotes feelings of trust, closeness, security, and emotional bonding.


​Vasopressin (The ""Attachment"" Hormone):


​This hormone is linked to behaviors that promote long-term, monogamous relationships and pair-bonding, generating a desire to protect one's partner.


​2. Brain Regions Involved


​Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have shown increased activity in several key brain regions when a person in love looks at a picture of their partner:


​Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA): 

A central part of the brain's reward system, rich in dopamine neurons. It is highly active and releases dopamine into other pleasure centers.


​Caudate Nucleus & Nucleus Accumbens: 

These are part of the reward and motivation centers. They ""light up"" in response to the anticipation and experience of being with the person.


​3. Deactivated Brain Areas


​Equally important are the areas that show reduced activity in early love:


​Prefrontal Cortex:

 The region associated with rational thought, critical judgment, and decision-making. Its reduced activity is sometimes cited as the reason why people ""put their partner on a pedestal"" and are less likely to notice or judge their flaws (i.e., wearing ""rose-colored glasses"").


​Amygdala:

 A key structure for processing emotions, particularly fear and negative judgment. Its lower activity may be why you feel a sense of emotional comfort and security with the person, and are more open to the vulnerability of falling in love.",22,2025-09-29,05:50:14

Today we went for what was supposed to be a short walk but we went to a little place to drink something so that took a bit longer lol. 

I initiated us hanging out on Sunday, she initiated Saturday and today. Asked her to hang out again, that's going to be this Friday, and yet i am here thinking: Holy heck she's incredible, but what if i mess things up by wanting to kiss her and her not wanting that and making it awkward?

I *am* an adult - I have a good career, bought my own home, and I'm raising a daughter - but I don't *feel* like an adult in my brain.  If it were up to me, I'd sit at home playing video games all day like when I was a kid.  I used to think there was something wrong with me and that all the other adults had their shit together and I didn't.  Talked to some of my friends about it and they feel the same way.  I guess that's part of why it kind of sucks being an adult sometimes.

When I was a kid, I actually thought some kind of mental switch flipped in your brain when you reached adulthood and you'd suddenly act and feel like an adult.  There is no switch.  What makes you an adult is the fact that you recognize and carry out your responsibilities as a functional member of society, even if you don't necessarily want to.  Being an adult *is* sort of performative in a way - at least in my opinion.

While some of my interests and sensibilities have changed as I've gotten older, I don't feel like I think all that differently than I did as a teenager. As far as I'm aware, it's totally normal.  I'm sure not all people function this way, but I do and every one of my adult friends I've spoken to feels that way as well.

Try not to worry about it too much, just keep doing what you're doing.  You're building your life at your own pace and that's how it should be.  As long as you can make reasonably good decisions to keep your life on track, you're probably doing just fine.",2,2025-09-29,15:09:31

Imagine you have a car. Brand new, perfect paint, leather interior, new car smell, all that jazz.

This, is your mentality, or your personality, whatever ypu want to call it. When you're young, it's amazing.

As time goes by, that same car gets dings and scrapes on the paintwork. Occasionally, a bird will crap on it. Sometimes, you'll eat chips in the car and leave crumbs in it. 

From time to time, you'll want it to go faster, so you'll get a different engine put in it, or you'll want beefy off-road tyres.

Every now and then, you'll have an accident, and have to replace some panels. Sometimes you'll be able to get the new panels painted the same colour as the rest of the car, sometimes you'll have to make do with whatever the junk yard has to offer.

Long story short, that car is the same car you'll have until the day you die. It's always the same car, but the experiences you have will shape the car to be somewhat different from what it was like when it was brand new (eg. When you were young). But at its most fundamental level, you'll be the same, albeit slightly different.",2,2025-09-29,16:38:15

It's normal to have areas where you have different desires, even tho to others they seem ""immature"". It depends a lot what maturity and being your age means to you.

**If I know one thing tho, is that age doesn't make you different, experiences do.** If you live until 40 and nothing happens to change your mentality, then you won't think like other 40 year olds who have been thru certain things.

What matured me the most when I was your age was the fact that me and my gf moved across the country at 19 all alone. We had to make it work from scratch. We dealt with bad financial situations, bad illnesses, house fixes and everything in between. Having nobody around to help out really forced me outside my box and doing things on my own. In those few years while we finished college, I changed more than I changed in all the rest. 

However as I said, maturity doesn't mean wanting a family or marriage necessarily. You can be mature and still have ""young"" hobbies and desires for your life. Some people never want to have kids or stuff like that.",1,2025-09-29,21:32:53

One example was a girl I had started casually dating several years ago.  She seemed nice, but her personality was a bit annoying to me at times.  Not annoying enough on it's own that it'd be a deal breaker, I just figured it was just something about her that I'd get used to.

First big red flag was after the first time she stayed over at my place.  She got up and left early in the morning while I was still sleeping, but not before writing a very nice note to me about what a great time she had, how she wants to do it again, etc. - then she *stuck it to the wall of my bedroom with chewed up gum.*  I had to repaint to cover it up.  This is related to the part of her personality that annoyed me.  She *idolized* Chelsea Handler (who I know of, but don't follow closely enough to really know anything about).  When I confronted her about the gum, she said she thought it'd be ""cute"" and that it was something ""Chelsea would do"".  She then apologized pretty sincerely and I let it go.

The deal breaker came after she, for some reason, thought it'd funny to brag to me about some guy she scammed out of $400 for a fake abortion.  She sent the guy a picture of a positive pregnancy test she found online, said she couldn't afford an abortion, and he sent her the money.  I don't know why she thought I'd find that funny, especially after her and I had already slept together a couple of times, but it was NOT funny to me.  She knew she messed up when I started asking her for the guy's name.  Obviously, she refused to give me any other info about it.  I asked her why she would do something like that and she said, once again, ""It was something Chelsea would do"" (I don't know if Chelsea Handler would actually do something like that, but this girl seemed to think so).  She told me she planned to write a book about her own life one day (like Chelsea did) and I guess this weird and terrible shit she was doing were just things she thought would be funny to read in said book.

That was it for me.  I told her that was a disgusting thing to do to someone, that she was a bad person, and that I wanted nothing more to do with her after that.  I also told her that she was not interesting enough to write a book about her life - that almost nobody would bother reading it, and those who did would simply just think she's a terrible, annoying human.  I probably shouldn't have said the last part, but I was really angry.  After that, I asked her to leave and that was it for our little fling.",4,2025-09-29,11:11:09

It doesn't matter. Go to the jeweler, tell them you plan to do this, estimate her ring size, go slightly larger (so it will fit on her finger), propose.

Then later you can go back to the jeweler together and get it sized, which she will probably feel is a very fun newly-engaged activity to participate in.

Alternatively, just take one of her existing rings and measure it or give it to the jeweler if she won't notice. If you do this keep in mind that different fingers are different sizes (because we are stupid and wouldn't think of this).",7,2025-09-29,05:23:25

There’s 2 reasons for this - the first is to confirm that she’s on board with marrying you, in case it wasn’t already made clear. The second is that there’s so many different decisions to be made - the cut, the setting, the style, the clarity, what kind of mineral it even is. The thickness of the band, the number of prongs, how the ring matches her outfits, if the engagement ring will be compatible with wedding bands, the material of the band, cathedral or not.

We started off looking at a dainty 0.6 carat princess cut at Birks and ended up custom making a 2 carat round cut with a petal setting at a jeweler, practically two ends of the spectrum.

If you want it to be a surprise (and assuming you’ve talked marriage and are on the same page, because that’s not a question you should ask unless you already know the answer!) maybe get a nice-looking fake as a placeholder and then go shopping after the proposal? My brother-in-law did that because the ring they designed wasn’t going to be ready in time for the vacation where he wanted to propose.

Best wishes!! It’ll be lovely and special whether it’s a surprise or not.",1,2025-09-29,16:28:15

Short answer is... Don't.  It shouldn't be a surprise THAT you propose, only when/where/how.  

If you haven't talked about your future, you've got no business proposing.  And if you've talked about your future, there's no harm in taking her ring shopping.  Pay attention to the rings she looks at the longest, get a feel for what she likes and doesn't like - and while you're there, have her sized.  That way,  you know for SURE the exact size SHE wants to wear, and she doesn't have to give up her engagement ring for a week to get it resized if you guess wrong.  (My wife, for some time after our engagement, that ring was the most important thing in her life, her pride and joy.  It would have devastated her to have to send it in for resizing.)

Once I had an idea of the things she liked, I had a ring custom made to incorporate the elements of the rings she liked the most.  End result is a ring that is exactly what she wanted, and nobody else on this planet has one.  I worked with a small local jeweler, and I personally hand-selected the diamond that went into the ring.",1,2025-09-29,18:21:50

I'd that doesn't work, get her a cheaper ring for her birthday or anniversary, etc and get her to help with sizing and picking it out.

AskMen,Over_Leave,1nt99v0,What’s her ring size?,126,0,35,Man_from_somewhere,ngx4c6t,"The correct way (which I learned of later) is to measure her finger either with string or with ring size keys when she sleeps or take a ring she already has (on the correct finger - very important!). 

What I actually did: I took her to my mom and we sneakily showed her rings that belonged to my late grandma and to my mom and had her try some of those. Silly me, she measured on the other hand and I guessed the ring size as two sizes down the smallest ring when it should've been three sizes (but not too bad, just take her to resize the ring after you propose as long as it's close enough to stay, usually it's less than a day's job). 
Worth it though, the surprise is priceless and a moment to remember :) 

Pick something you know she loves, not too flashy (unless that's what she likes), and maybe consult her friends/family if they can keep a secret.

Edit: after reading some comments here, maybe it's important to note we knew we wanted to get married, I used the opportunity when friends got engaged and she commented on the ring and asked what's a perfect engagement ring in her mind. From there I had something I designed custom made.

Don’t sweat it, just buy the care plan. It covers sizing, cleanings, if a diamond falls out and gets lost in most cases etc. Buy the ring you want her to wear in whatever size you want. If she says yes and it doesn’t fit (it won’t fit RIGHT anyways unless you get her sized or she wears a ring on that finger already that you can get sized) THEN get it sized correctly.

This shit is so life ruining, I've probably lost around 10k dollars overall doing parlays, I've even wasted money on parlay telegram and discord groups (spoiler: they don't fucking work) and it's damaged relationships. Gambling is just too fkn addictive.



I'm basically 4 months clean but I had to download apps like app locker for my phone and selfcontrol for my pc so I wouldn't visit betting apps or websites, stuff like sunflower sober has also helped to track and the site blocking overall has been effective but the NBA season hasn't started (although i used to bet on summer league games and that didn't happen this time!) so I'm kinda worried that when the season starts I'll go get that hit and do parlays again.



Pretty much half my friends group does it so it's pretty hard to just stop thinking about it entirely. I wonder how bad of an issue it's become in general, these past few years it's just grown and grown in popularity.

Yes, I was majorly addicted. For context, I was in my 30s, with a wife and a newborn, when I fell deep into gambling. It started with small parlays on apps, then a friend introduced me to his bookie. I set a $500 limit, hit a few bets, and thought I had it figured out. Before long, I raised the limit, started chasing losses, and when I couldn’t cover payments, I used my credit card. That’s when things spiraled.

I maxed out the card, then secretly took out a personal loan to “fix it,” but ended up gambling that away too. Eventually, I was $45,000 in debt. I lied to my wife about how bad it was, first saying it was a few thousand, until the real number finally came out. That was rock bottom.

It’s been 513 days since my last bet. In that time, we paid off all $45k, and my wife and I worked to rebuild trust. There’s still some lingering resentment, which I fully deserved, but life is better. The urges never disappeared, but I learned it only takes one bad decision to lose everything again.

So my advice to you is. If you don’t have the proper support system around you, do not start. It took me forever to realize that I was just chasing that next dopamine hit and there are better ways to find it.",32,2025-09-29,17:21:13

That said, you should also stack the deck offline. Men who “look better in person” win by getting face-to-face faster so approaching, social events, speed dating, even leveraging mutual friends. Online is just a funnel, not the only route. If you know your strength is real-life presence, you want to shorten the online gap and get into environments where women can actually feel your vibe.

Has it ever happened to you that a date went really well, you even hooked up, but then you never kept in touch afterwards? 

What made you not want to stay in contact ?

Was it lack of chemistry after the fact? Timing? Fear of leading the other person on?

AskMen,Aware_Fox_2018,1ntmghc,What reasons would make you not call back after a good first date ?,73,0,13,CountOff,nguv26w,"Everyone else is giving general answers so I'll give a more specific situation that happens a lot these days and happened to me when I was young and dumb. You have to remember that implicit in your tatement of ""the date went really well, you even hooked up, but then you never kept in touch afterwards"" is that I'm assuming you're saying this was a date you were on to see if things could be committed potentially instead of just a date for casual sex. That would have a different nuance than my comment is assuming so if that's not what you intend let me know

So implicit in your post is the idea that **from the girls perspective**, the date was good and you guys had a connection and had sex, and he doesn't call back. Chances are this guy knows you're into him (e.g. it's obvious on the date that you're into him more than just wanting to fuck him) so we're gonna assume in this situation he knows he's not gonna commit before he sleeps with you. These assumptions don't have to be true (see my other example at the end of this post), but I'm just picking some assumptions that happen often enough that they're worth discussing. So you're asking for sake of argument, about the mindstate of the type of person who is willing to lead you on for sex knowing you probably want more than just that; but this person knows they don't. 

Sometimes people do the behavior you're describing because they see something on the date (a red flag, a deal breaker, etc.) that they don't know how to talk about without it potentially causing a bigger scene. I'll give you a common example: dude matches with a girl on a dating app, pictures are of her with one body type, they meet up for the first date and the rapport is the same, but she clearly doesn't look like her pictures anymore. You were more attracted to her in her pictures than you are to her in the modern day, to the point it's a deal breaker for a committed relationship but not necesssarily enough for casual sex.

From that perspective, the rest of the date ""going well"" now looks different from these two people's perspectives if the girl comes into the date still with a mind towards this being potentially something serious instead of something casual. 

You can change the reason to fit whatever, whether it's ""girl is 50 pounds heavier irl than in pictures"" to ""the date was going great then she said she makes major life decisions by consulting her horoscope"" People rant on dates and say shit that betrays who they actually are under the surface all the time; there just isn't often a big bright alarm bell that goes off by the other person where they go ""wow what you just said is mad unhinged"". A lot of ppl just smile and nod and think about a get away plan (that clearly for some, still involves hooking up with you)

So as you can see, a lot of it from that point on comes down to the subjectivity of ""it was a good first date and we hooked up"" and what that means to both parties.

There are definitely dates dudes go on where they realize ""oh this girl is not a good idea to be with for [insert reason here], but i am attracted to her and she seems into me so let's see where this goes for the night"" and it ends in sex. She might describe that as a good first date from her perspective because she has no idea he has made that internal note. She might think they're having sex because the connection was that strong and the date was so good, so on and so forth...

After that's over and the post act clarity starts to kick in...well now you're in a conundrum as the dude. How do you break this off?

Do you:

1) be direct and tell her you're not feeling it while being vague as fuck about why because the real reason could hurt her esp. if she's nice (yes yes yes the dude here is a dick, and he prob shouldn't have lead her on for sex. I'm just giving you their thought process)

2) Be full direct with no vagueness and hope she doesn't flip out on you (people are definitely entitled to be angry about this; i'm just saying these dudes fear the girl keying their car etc.)

3) Say absolutely nothing, maybe block her and remove her on every social she followed you on

A lot of people pick 3) these days because if the person you're dealing with is a crashout, that explosion is guarded against. Obviously the drawback is if the person is not a crashout, you just really hurt someone's feelings. 

Unfortunately a reality of human behavior is that there are a lot of people who are willing to potentially hurt someone's feelings if it makes their lives more convenient. Like even if the other person isn't a crashout but it'd just be an awkward conversation, they'd still choose the convenience of avoidance. So while it is a risk avoidance behavior, some people will pick it just because that's how little they care about the other person.

Other reasons ppl do this is because they think they're ready to date again and they're really not...like once the thing starts getting *real* they realize it's scarier than they anticipated and they can't do this. Usually hits after the post nut clarity on the date; esp. the days immediately following it. Slowly distance and grow colder and then *poof*, just like that. Looks a lot like using you for sex, but usually people who aren't being honest enough with themselves about the reasons they fear love at this moment while still playing around in the dating game.",15,2025-09-29,13:59:02

I have never had sex on a first date. Never had a one night stand. I always needed an emotional connection with someone before feeling comfortable with that. I mean the idea is nice, in theory. 


However, in my experience I also am not ""a looker"". I'm not your ""tall, dark, and handsome"" guy. I mean you can clean up, dress nicely, be funny, and use appropriate behavior, but you can't really be taller or be more handsome. So I have always needed to make girls laugh, and or charm them. I need to soak in a bit, if you will. 


I have also wondered, quite a bit, what it's like to be one of those guys. I do alright for myself in life, but at first glance at least, I would be rejected or picked last by a large majority of women, based on height, hair, looks, or probably income. 


I think a lot of girls, naturally, want that in a guy. So they swipe right, say yes, and or sleep with these guys right away because he does it for her. I mean, I don't blame them. Who doesn't want a gorgeous mate? But it also occurs to me that if I was one of those guys, and I could go on one date and get a girl to sleep with me, why wouldn't I just keep doing that? What's my incentive to call her back and talk her into a second date? If everything isn't absolutely perfect, and I have women calling and texting me in line ready to date me, where is my motivation to stick to one? 


Granted, I am merely speculating here this could be at play and don't actually know what I'm talking about. Good luck to you. ",1,2025-09-29,15:20:31

Posting on my wife’s account as I’m not a “Redditor” but she talks about you guys all the time.

I (35m) have 2 kids with wife of 10 years, moved and started a new job almost a year ago. There are so many positives. Decent pay raise, no managing people, better people to work with, and my kids have a great school. On the downside, I work a lot more hours, the work is much more high demand (we are expected to always be available), and also have community commitments I’m expected to do outside of work. 

I’m drowning in feeling like I’m running from one thing to another, my wife’s unhappy with the amount of time I spend at home/with her, and I desperately need alone time to recharge. I literally have no more hours in the day. Diet and exercise are good, I spend 45 minutes in the gym 3x a week, bring my lunch, and eat at home most nights.

Your mental health (and physical) are crucial especially at this age.

I had a job where I needed to be available all the time, it sucked! I had to leave and find another job. 
Now I still have a high demanding job but I control my time and it’s so much better! I have more time with kids, I have more time to help the community (I’m involved in multi million dollar projects within the community completely for free because I have the energy and time to help).

If so, might be worth seeing if y’all can afford having someone take care of those responsibilities for you sometimes so you can have more time. A house cleaner or gardener can feel expensive, but it can be worth it if you can still make ends meet and have that time freed up to spend with your loved ones instead. 

Outside of that, there isn’t much you can do other than looking into changing your work hours or community commitments. While more money and community involvement are always good, just remember that time is the only thing we can’t really buy back. You have to prioritize. 

Figure out what’s necessary (both financially and for your happiness) and see if there’s any changes you can make to boost your family time. Maybe you can start working towards a lateral move that will give you more free time or at least a lower stress environment for work. Or maybe there’s another way you can keep contributing to whatever community stuff you’re involved in while using less time, or something that would allow you to involve your kids and wife more frequently. 

Just remember we get old and one day you might not be able to run around with your kids on your back without your knees snapping. Don’t wait for retirement (or an arbitrary goal that isn’t necessary) to carve out time for your family in the present.

Focus and speed. Do what you must to get things accomplished and be effective at it. Adopt the mindset of “always be closing” , work efficiently, fast and move to the next task. 

Also, it’s okay if things aren’t optimal. 

Oh .. and the key to doing less work is having high visibility and direct impact to the financial figures. Think about it. Do you think partners at a firm are working hard or a lot? Hell no.. their job is business development, client facing, relationship building.. they don’t sit at a desk and work on specific jobs. They get paid to bring in the work. So start being on the high visibility and direct value and impact to your company then you don’t have to work so hard, come in late to the office, not worry about anything other than “how much does the company stand to profit off my network.”

Outsource what you can. For me, that’s the Cleaning and cooking bit. And child mending when I’m at work (meeting customers) or out dating.

Yes, I have a personal life too. I blend my hobbies and exercise (golf, gym x3 a week, evening runs (great excuse for a date), tennis, travel, corporate meals and meeting people) with my work (business dev at the golf course, networking). By combining activities and blending work and play, you’re being extremely time efficient and effective! 

So while I’ve managed to blend work and play, I unfortunately have to split my time between dating and my kids. When I’m not out on a date, I’m spending the time with my children. Sundays is full on kids day only and we bond by doing activities and school work together. I’m very involved with my kids, helping them to do art and crafts, math, revision, everything. 

As for dating.. It’s taken 2 whole years to establish, but I have a good amount of women that I’m seeing casually. And before any dude asks how does that happen even as a single dad? The secret sauce answer is to start off as friends first. Don’t go thinking with your penis. Treat them nicely, get to really know them and be friends. Sooner or later, they’re going to invite you over to hang out with and fool around casually. And no hard feelings there.. because you started off as good friends first, sex isn’t the foundation of your relationship and even if it goes away (that they find a BF, or you get into a ltr), they are going to remember that you genuinely cared for them and treated them nicely without the pressure of sex. Women remember that about you and won’t get offended if you go about having random sex with other women. You don’t have to flash it infront of them (and you should never do that) , but you can let them know you’re hanging out a girl who’s a “friend” to you and she won’t mind it. Having sex with this friend is already implicit..",1,2025-09-29,21:20:12

I like to believe that everyone can be happy. However I do acknowledge that this potential for happiness that each person has won't be attained by everyone, and some people unfortunately will not be content with their lives. I find that to be very sad. Even more heartbreaking is that the people I love are not exempt. Not all my friends will be content, not all my family members will be content. 

It sounds very childish, but I really wish people, especially people I love can be as happy as I am, and it saddens me that that isn't the case.

Can this desire for others to be happier arise from some sort of selfishness? I love them with all my heart but is it somehow more noble to love them without caring that they be happier? But it is wrong to be indifferent as to whether or not the people I love are happy. I'm not sure if I am making sense here. 

Is there a way to be more active in helping them out? More active than simply being a friend that cares. However I expect that trying very actively to help out more than a friend typically would, would end up changing the dynamic and it not longer being a healthy friendship?

I think a healthy way to tackle it would be an buddhist type of detachment. In that I can provide as much love and care as I currently do, and at the same time not be too attached to the outcome I want of them being happier.

So I guess to summarize, I would like to know how you handle this situation and what if you know of any philosophers/thinkers that tackled this topic -- The reality that people you truly love might never reach a point of stable contentment.

Honestly though mate. Lift those around you up by being a positive influence. But don't ruin your own contentment trying to fix other people. What I've found in my life is that people need to go through their own journeys. 

So many people make drama up out of nothing. Even if you bend over backwards and break yourself thinking *""if I just fix x problem for them, then they will have no more problems""*, you'll find that's wrong and that people will have some kind of problem pop up immediately. There's always one more problem.

I just try to continue to be a positive influence. Don't feed into drama. Be there to talk and listen to, be supportive and kind. Show love however you do. But whatever i do, i don't fall into a trap of trying to fix other people.

If friends are going through hard times, I'll organise hangouts to get them out of the house. Or I'll bake them cookies or take them food or take them on a walk. Or something. Things that I already do, positive experiences and habits I'll share with them. Etc.

I am unsafe and I need to get away. 

> How long do you keep distant from your partner?

Don't have one, but even in the times where I did have love, there was no consistency with it. Keep in mind my experience means nothing to you since I'm not the person you're thinking about, you'll have to be curious directly to him if you want his emotional landscape. 

> What are the reasons you shut down and distance yourself?

I am repeating myself at this point. I do not feel safe. Either I've been given enough of a reason to believe I'm not good enough, I'm not wanted, I'm not trying, or I am in some way awful for my attempts to be my best. My withdrawal is the result of the felt harm to my ego, and of my beliefs that I'm more safe away from the stimulus that feels actively harmful.

> Have you used this as a way to slowly phase out of a relationship?

Not intentionally. I have lost before as a result of withdrawal, but I have never personally intended to lose it. I sought out ways to feel safe. The only consistent path for that is alone. If anything, it was my way of trying to hold onto the relationship as best I could. I found it far nicer to seek space than to be caught in the rage of emotions and say words that would forever harm her and us.  

> Or do you come back feeling stronger about your relationship? 

It was not my experience, the harm had still been done, but at least with space and time I was able to suppress the rage within.

If this is about someone you love and care about, then I would ask you to sincerely show him curiosity. He's got a story to tell you and if you are willing to hear it, then there's a chance you can repair and even strengthen your bonds. That will only come with the curiosity to want to know his experience, and to sit together with him in it.",1,2025-09-29,19:00:09

AskMen,aspiringdeadgirl,1ntumsk,What are some reasons you shut down when stressed?,33,0,4,ThornedAbyss,ngx42wj,"I'll answer a slightly different question than the one you're asking.

If something crazy happens my wife is quick to react and she gets upset that I don't react as quickly as her. 

For example, our daughter starts choking on food and vomits it up. My wife's reaction is to immediately rush her to the sink so she can vomit there. Mine is to think about it for a second, put a napkin under her chin to catch the food, then wipe up anything she may have gotten on her shirt. I prefer my way better because it makes less mess (not cleaning any vomit that got on the ground when my wife is carrying her to the sink). 

That's just one example of many that have happened in our relationship. My wife reacts immediately and gets pissed I don't do that same. I tell her I want to slow down, take a moment to process what's happening, think about the best solution, then make a decision.

AskMen,Marcus977,1ntwh8k,How do you keep believing in relationships when the effort feels bigger than the reward ?,9,0,2,AutoModerator,ngwt2u3,"Here's an original copy of /u/Marcus977's post (if available):

I’d love to hear other guys opinions on how I’ve been seeing relationships lately.

In my late teens and early 20s, I was the hopeless romantic type. I idealized love and spent a lot of time daydreaming about when my time would finally come. I did fall in love once, but I got burned. Years passed, I tried dating here and there with no success. I gave the apps a shot too, and like I expected, nothing meaningful came from them.

Now I’m 28, and it’s like a switch flipped. I feel numb when it comes to relationships. The desire and energy I used to have to put myself out there just isn’t there anymore.

On paper, I’d say I’m not doing bad even a bit better on some aspects. I’m not model-tier, but I’ve got a good job, I work out, and I take care of myself. Still, I feel like I can’t attract the type of women I’m genuinely drawn to. And when I think about the numbers, the countless dates, the rejections, the effort it takes just to maybe get a yes, I start asking myself: is it even worth it?

Even if I do find someone, what if she’s just settling for me? What kind of relationship, what kind of life, would that be?

It makes me wonder if the statistics are just stacked against me. And at this stage in my life, I honestly don’t know how to process these thoughts.

Does anyone else feel this way, or am I just overthinking it?

AskMen,michaelmoby,1nty1qi,How to deal with a giant f*ck-all mustache when eating and drinking!?,9,0,1,AutoModerator,ngx51yg,"Here's an original copy of /u/michaelmoby's post (if available):

I want to grow a big old Sam Goddamned Elliot type mustache.  Something Victorian, something porn-star-ish.  Think Jerry's Crambone cowboy cousin from Tom and Jerry.  I've had facial hair for decades, but always kept it short and tidy.  Now that I'm a middle-aged man whose facial hair has gone snow white, I've found that there are some challenges that go along with growing longer facial hair, and I need some help/advice.  
  
When I grow my mustache out/once it gets to covering my upper lip, eating and drinking become a challenge.  How do you keep your whiskers out of your food and drink when you're trying to grow something magnificent?  I ate a bowl of Lucky Charms and spent half the day not realizing my otherwise Santa-white mustache had turned Violet Beauregarde blue.  I have to wipe my face with a napkin every time I take a sip of my morning coffee to keep it from getting discolored.  It's at that length where it's long enough to be annoying, but not long enough to style (and keep it out of my own mouth).  The long whiskers are making me look like I have a drinking problem every time I take a sip of something (the Airplane! type of drinking problem).

So tell me, oh great Ron Swansons of the interwebs, how do you handle the inbetween phase?

AskMen,ByGabi18,1ntley7,"When Instagram Attention Feels Empty: How to Attract Real, Intellectual Connections Online?",8,0,0,AutoModerator,nguewe4,"Here's an original copy of /u/ByGabi18's post (if available):

I've been single for a few months now and recently started being more active on Instagram — posting more stories, replying to some messages, and generally engaging more. Naturally, this has led to some girls reaching out. Some of them are definitely attractive, but when I get to know them, their personalities mostly revolve around watching TikTok and going to parties. On the other hand, a few girls who seem like they might have more interesting personalities don’t catch my eye physically.

So, I've been thinking about rebranding my profile to show more of who I really am, instead of just playing the typical “NPC” card where the focus is only on looks and clichés. I even started a highlighted stories section where I share some of the books I love — for example, Seneca’s *Letters to Lucilius* — but I’m not sure if that’s the best approach.

I’m curious: What else could I do on social media to attract more intellectual types? And how can I meet smart, interesting, and attractive people in real life? I just finished my degree and am working on a very solo project, so I don’t really meet many new people. The girls I meet at parties, no matter how attractive, just don’t appeal to me personality-wise.

Any advice or personal experiences would be really appreciated.

I’ve dealt with severe body dysmorphia and anorexia in the past and got iver the brunt of it like two years back but still have trouble understanding if other people find my body attractive and when I overthink it I tend to back away from and avoid romatic interactions? I’m wondering how I can overcome this obstacle in dating? I’m pretty and I know it but my body still makes me a bit insecure.

I’m basically built like a shorter avatar (5’4) and yes i mean the blue people 😭 flat ass/boobs and hip dips like no joke same exact build but is that like a major turn off and could how I see myself negatively affect relationships? I personally think its pretty cool and i like how my body looks but is that like something most dudes care about ton about? (I’ve been staying away from dating since I wanted to deal with my mental health before getting into relationships but I’m much better and happier now aside from small issues and now that im thinking more about relationships im just a tad bit curious) I also wonder if those body image issues could cause a strain on any future relationships? I’ve also noticed I tend to to push men away when we get close in fear of how they see me or how it could affect me- again trying to work past it

If you're honest with a partner, let them know that sometimes you might not take compliments well, but that doesn't mean you don't appreciate them, even if that nasty part of your brain doesn't. Be up-front when you're in a bad place, because life will happen and it will ebb and flow, but try and always put a timeline for them to check in, or you to update them about how you're feeling, rather than leaving it as an empty timeline. It could be like ""sometimes I'll have a bad day"" meaning that day should be avoided, or ""sometimes I have a bad few days"", so they should expect to chill for 3 days or so, it doesn't have to be in your Google Calendars when your brain will be better again.

I also had another partner who had anorexia athletica, but was fairly controlled and stable. But she would occasionally have days where she only ate rabbit food, and would feel compelled to work out till she was bruised and dead. In that case we just agreed that if I noticed those signs, that would be good enough for me to know I should avoid comments, and she was comfortable enough to get through it on her own. We also agreed that while I would try to accommodate that part of her, we wouldn't let it get in the way of things, like if we had planned to go somewhere that didn't really offer safe food, she would do what she could to still be okay, but she could either tell me there, or before hand, if it was too bad and we needed to change/reschedule. But she had it pretty well handled, so it didn't really get in the way too much.

I turn around, drive to my Ex’s house because she was teaching from home during Covid. Make plans to stay in a hotel and figure shit out. My place didn’t burn down, but the smoke and water damaged pretty much everything.

Come to find out, the neighbor who lived below me and to the right (old guy about 80) somehow started a fire in his condo. (Next part is from maintenance guy who saw the whole thing from another building). It got big enough, his oxygen tank caught fire and blew up. The explosion from the tank caused the windows from the back of his condo to blow out and fire rushed up the side on the condo (2-3 stories depending on where it was). Soon enough the condo above it was completely engulfed and like 10 fire trucks showed up to put it out.

It took 1 1/2 years to rebuild the building apparently, I took the insurance money (for my stuff), sold the place while it was still gutted and had bought a nicer one in a better part of town 2 months later.

What’s up

I have a female friend I met at an old job about three years ago. We used to talk a lot at work and got pretty close during our time there. Back in the day, yeah I had feelings for her but I’ve made my peace and I see her as a really good friend. Eventually, we went our separate ways professionally, but we’ve still kept in touch often.

We mainly text — no phone calls, and we haven’t seen each other in person in three years, even though we live in the same city. Our conversations over text are always good, and we keep up with each other’s lives. But every time I suggest hanging out in person or even just talking on the phone (strictly as friends), she avoids it or changes the subject.

She does have a boyfriend, which I respect, but I’m starting to question what kind of friendship this really is. At this point, I’m not sure if it’s even a friendship anymore.

What do you think?

Whom she wrote them for or shared them with and how she shared them would be more relevant when it comes to infidelity.

As for disloyalty, it could certainly be a sign that she's not that into her partner and thus he needs to rethink whether he needs to change his tactics or if he should even be with her if she doesn't want him.

>If the characters are fictional people and the story world is a fantasy/unrealistic world (like with dragons and stuff), would that make a difference as opposed to a real person/world, i.e. fanfiction?

Fixating on a real person outside of the relationship is a huge red flag, especially if she has a connection to that other person.

If it's not a bad sign for the health of the relationship, it's in exceedingly poor taste to write erotica about a real person without their consent or involvement.

>Does the purpose of the story matter?

There are a number of forms of dirty pen pal that would either constitute infidelity or be flirting with it, so, yeah, to some extent, when it is a factor.

>Would you feel offended if the main character in these stories is very different from you, either physically or personality-wise?

I wouldn't feel *offended*, but I would need to know if she's actually into me, and fixating on creating erotic content about people radically different from me would be a good sign to confirm the situation if our sex life wasn't of a caliber to preclude even considering such things.

And if she's not into me, we shouldn't be together.

>Furthermore, do you think writing these characters is equivalent to lusting after/idealizing them? 

On the one hand, No, not necessarily

On the other hand, that's usually part of the equation anyway if it's going to be any good, so there's not much point in the distinction in the vast majority of scenarios.",1,2025-09-29,15:34:50

I’m currently in my late twenties and I still look like a 18-20 year old. I teach students at the university, who are supposed to be fresh out of high school and the majority of guys… easily look 5-10 years older. It does affect my self-esteem quite a bit, and the fact that I’ve always struggled with eating disorders doesn’t help as I’m skinnier than most. 


I have struggled a lot with this throughout my life: people not taking me seriously because I look so young, not being able to find romantic partners around the same age as most of them are interested in mature-looking men, and small things like getting ID’d everywhere I go… So, when does it get better?

Potentially not for many years still.

I'm 42 and still get ID'ed everywhere, and the employees always make a comment like ""Wow, you're lucky"".

Women who are my peers think I am *dramatically* younger than them so often I'm not even a consideration.

People think I'm young and say things like ""You have lots of time"" until they learn my real age.

I have no grey hair, and the only wrinkles are faint forehead wrinkles I've had since I was a teenager. Still can't grow a beard to save my life. Split a taxi last year with a couple in their upper 40s and they thought I was a university student traveling around. Had a woman at a music festival tell me she had a son who was around my age, then shared he was 26. Ran into three people in their 50s who complimented my sunglasses, I told them I've had them for decades since I was a teenager. They didn't believe I was decades away from being a teenager until I showed them my ID.

AskMen,Outrageous_South_439,1ntsdtp,Why does society put having children on a pedestal?,84,0,0,AutoModerator,ngvxek9,"Here's an original copy of /u/Outrageous_South_439's post (if available):

My wife and I have been going through infertility for the last six years. I am 36 and she is almost 40. I often hear parents say that we’re missing out and that children are the most wonderful thing, but I’ve seen how having kids can test marriages and sometimes even break relationships. It creates conflicting feelings for me; on one hand, I recognize that not having children might be a blessing in disguise, yet I don’t want to rely on kids for my happiness. I envisioned going through this journey as a team with my wife.

Infertility has significantly impacted our relationship, particularly our sex life, and it raises concerns about what our future might look like in our 40s if we remain child-free. Social media doesn’t help, as it often portrays children as the ultimate purpose in life. I can’t help but wonder what that means for men, especially given the loneliness crisis many face. It feels like society expects us to procreate to find true meaning and validation, as if a man isn’t complete without a child.

We’ve tried adoption and fostering but faced rejections, and surrogacy is beyond our financial means. We underwent one IVF cycle, which was devastating and felt like a more profound grief than losing loved ones. It took years for me to recover, plus therapy, and I’m hesitant to go through that again. My wife is struggling even more with this, particularly since she wanted to start a family when we married. She’s facing an identity crisis, connecting her love for me with the idea of being a father, and she hasn’t considered any backup plans.

In the beginning, while we were being careful, my wife convinced me that I would make a great dad, and I was all in, despite being visually impaired and initially not wanting kids. Now, I feel I can be content without them, but a part of me always wonders if I’ll regret it. I understand that some things are out of our control, yet I often hear misguided advice, like “you just have to want it badly enough” or suggestions to get a dog as a distraction. We got a dog, but I realized I’m not a dog person; it was mostly to help us cope with our grief.

I can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing something, especially when talking to people with kids. I enjoy being around children and feel good with them, and I often wonder what my life would look like as a parent. While I can see the potential blessing in disguise of our situation, it’s a topic rarely discussed. I know I’m not alone in feeling this way, but if I were to tell a parent that you don’t need kids to find happiness, they might respond that we’re missing out on something extraordinary. It’s a complex and conflicting situation, and I genuinely want to support my wife through it as we navigate our feelings together. Can anyone relate to this?

Fact is, the drive and glory of having children is just that: biological. Your worth and meaning should go a lot deeper than biological instinct, but you’ve got to go find it yourself.

My wife and I found our equivalent in adopting the oldest and most unwanted dogs and cats we can find.

We have a partially paralyzed cat that was thrown from a moving car when he was a year old. He was incontinent and had zero mobility in his back half. Now he just walks a little funny.

My wife found our second cat at 5 weeks old in the middle of the road. She had a crushed back leg and was septic. She’s a princess now and moves so well most people don’t notice she only has three legs.

We had a 15 year old blind, deaf, epileptic Jack Russel. We’d hide his food in a different place every day and he acted like a puppy again, sniffing it out and barking when he found it.

I could go on and on, but we’ve found a lot of joy in bringing animals like this into a good home and watching them heal and show the spark of what they were before they were hurt, abused, or neglected.",5,2025-09-29,17:32:13

It cost me 3 rounds and $85,000 \[of pre-inflation dollars\] to learn that lesson. In that case we did produce exactly one beautiful baby girl who is in the process of potty training herself. Seriously, she weaned herself from the bottle too, something is amiss with this lunatic.

As much as IVF blows for men, it is 150% harder on women for a variety of reasons. Not the least of which are the herculean number of hormone shots you have to take. That, alone, messed with your head. Then there is the semi-judgemental looks you can get at certain points. Try and comfort a woman who goes through an egg retrieval and gets two eggs and neither go from zygote to embryo. That is like that video of a bike race where the gates went down at the wrong time and everyone ate their face in the dirt, that is what having an egg retrieval like that is, except you have to pay (a lot) for it and it is fee for service not fee for result.

Here is my advice, take it for what it is worth, which is little to nothing but for I am a veteran of this process. If there is any possible way to do another attempt, do it. You are going to want to exhaust all chances that are practical. It is one thing if you can't do it because you tried as hard as you could and it didn't work and not being able to do it because you gave up.

Society puts having kids ""on a pedestal"" because if it didn't the human race would cease to exist in a few generations. If we aren't having kids then all of what humanity has achieved will be lost. You can argue that losing all the cat videos on the internet is not such a great loss to the universe, but that's a different convo. 


Having kids is also probably the best thing ever and so if someone has had them they would want you to experience the same thing. Seems logical imo.


With regard to the downsides. They are (can be) very stressing to a relationship where you go from being each other's most important person to taking a bit of a back seat. Doing anything is now more expensive and more complicated (remember diaper bag, does this car rental have a baby seat, is the kid gonna scream the whole flight....). The amount of money wasted on diapers...


So I say if you can have them, have them, but if you can not, then there is plenty else in life to enjoy and missing one experience will enable a lot of other experiences. ",2,2025-09-29,17:12:49

If I am to stay with him, I must find a way to be at peace with what seems the most likely future.

Not being able to have kids, for whatever reason, does not change the reality of your own capacity to raise a child well.

We place value on kids in the context of marriage because the want of a family is, across cultures, the reason we get married.

But in the absence of children, the fundamental duty of a spouse is to their spouse. We are not purely animals, for whom the needs of parents become largely irrelevant when their children are grown. We are humans, and it is ours to be present for the experience of each era of our lives, regardless of what happens in them.

In the consideration of a future without children (which may not even be what comes to pass), you must reckon with the fact that you will still exist, you will still have made this pact of companionship with another, and you will need to find something to do with your time because you, as a human, were not born *just* to continue the species.

Your assessment that you would be a good dad is probably accurate simply because you *want* children this badly. Nothing can take the fact that you would probably be a great dad from you, nor can anything take the reality that your wife would likely be a great mom from her. These are capacities you already possess, not titles to be earned.

It is the unfortunate state of the world that, for most, the thing they are at the time they live is not what ends up being needed. How you become okay with the disconnect between “what you could do” and “what you actually end up doing” is the problem that is each of ours to solve. Don’t let anyone rob you of that by suggesting that you didn’t become what you thought you could be because you didn’t try hard enough; that’s a childish perspective that is unfitting of a parent. Parents have two roles regarding their child’s potential: to encourage exploration of what is technically possible, and to prepare them for when their wants can’t be, which always happens.

Consider a new future not as an act of abandoning the one that appears unlikely, but as an exercise in that which you would have had to do for a child anyway. That which makes great parents great is also what makes them great spouses to each other. There would have come a day when your hypothetical child would come to you in tears and rage at the belief that the thing they wanted was never going to happen, and on that day you would have had to remind them that they did not exist for the sake of a narrow set of possible futures.

Now you must do this for each other. If you do end up having kids, you will only be better prepared for having done it before.

We do not need to deny that we could find happiness in the possibilities that are inconsistent with our deepest wants to “properly” dedicate ourselves to the narrower set of possibilities that are consistent with our stated wants.",1,2025-09-29,19:57:38

On a selfish level, without it, a given society will most probably die out, directly or indirectly harming all members still a part of it. 

There's also the intangibles around child rearing that drive people. ""Best thing I've ever done"", ""Gives meaning to life"" etc. Not guaranteed but people project their qualia of life onto others for good or for ill. 

None of this justifies the pedestalling but if you are self interested in the sustainable continuation of your community, pro-child is a logical stance.",0,2025-09-29,17:17:38

- S. Specific. It's fine they specify. 
- Measurable. In this case, same as specific. 
- Achievable.  This is where it completely falls apart. Most modern women do not give achievable expectations, for any human. Let alone any men they might be interested in. 
- reasonable. Same here. It's just not reasonable, by most standards. They think, because they met one, it just mean most can make it. 
- timely. They already expect men to be making it. 

They fail the smart goal template, then wonder why they end up old and alone, quoting ""not lower standards"" like some parrot. 

The modern compromise should be: we can both achieve x amount, over the next y number of years. We should try to save b amount, together, and get yadda yadda.

Instead, they want to demand, and wonder why... that's where I draw the line. Be reasonable, let it be achievable. Further, a lot of these women aren't even cute enough to be demanding anything.

AskMen,LeatherCow851,1ntp115,Is it healthy to use conversational AI as your only friend?,42,0,0,bajungadustin,ngvpixu,"I'm sure that most will say this is not healthy.

But.

I don't necessarily agree.

This really depends on what the conversation is about. There is a common tactic used in psychology and behavior modificatuon that involves talking to yourself in the mirror and saying positive things about yourself. Sometimes just saying them can make you feel better. Saying then enough can make you believe it.

So if you stand in front of a mirror and say something like ""I am beautiful and I am enough"" or something like that it's literally supposed to boost your self confidence. And it's effectively not different than having someone else say it..  Even if it's an AI.

If the AI conversation is a positive influence on your mental health and it makes you feel better then it's not hurting anyone. The alternative for someone who is a hardcore introvert would be talking to no one.

Being alone can be peaceful. Having conversations that can end exactly when you want them to and go back to being alone sounds like the gold standard of conversations for an introvert.

If you ever start to develop a romantic attachment to the  AI... Then I would think that maybe crosses a line.

But if this AI conversation is essentially a hype man for your life.. Or just a alternate version of positive affirmations about yourself to make you feel good. Then I don't see an issue. Having conversations with an Ai that just gives you positive feedback on your life is great.

The only major issue I see is that the AI might not point out issues. Like if you directly ask it if ""this thing you said at work"" was OK or not... It might not be objective and instead just tell you ""hey you did the best you can"" where a person would maybe tell you that it wasn't socially acceptable.

So depends on how good the AI is and conversational dialog and putting it's own ""thoughts"" or observations into the conversation to address issues.

I'm sure if a serial killer had an AI telling him he really did a good job dismembering that body last night... Well... That's an issue.",3,2025-09-29,16:23:51

I think it's more nuanced than that. I think it can be helpful if you use it as a supplement to real life interactions instead of a replacement for them. There are things to watch out for, like being aware that the AI can fluff up your shitty ideas and make you think you're some genius even if you're not, so keep that in mind. And being aware that the AI model can suddenly change under you which can be an unpleasant experience.

I don't think you should be getting in relationships when your mental state (whether classified illness or not) is going to put unnecessary strain on the relationship and other person.

Like if you have trauma stemming from sexual history, getting into a relationship with someone who needs to walk on egg-shells or put up with some day-to-day mental gymnastics to get laid isn't fair to the other person.

Same goes for basically everything emotional/mental. You should be entering relationships as **mentally healthy and emotionally available as possible**.

With today's leniency in dating and relationships and changes in how we perceive life stages, I (36f) see more and more men in their 30s and 40s retaining an unusually close mother-child relationship out of security and emotional dependency. Considering this age means the mother is elderly or approaching her elder years, the side of the coin hasn't flipped yet, so to speak. She is still taking care of him, and not the other way around. The term ""Mama's Boy"" almost seems like a universality. 

Was Freud right? Or is there a more simplistic reason for men prioritizing their mothers over any other woman?

With the housing and rental market as it is, I also suspect that a wider range of people are economically forced to live in multigenerational homes. 


Also, in many areas of my country there are a plethora of untreated or inadequately treated health issues. To put it simply, a large (and arguably growing) portion of the population simply aren't healthy/functioning adults, and that alone can impact one's ability to live independently. 


My country also has a very limited public safety net. Meaning, if an individual is struggling to make ends meet, then they're forced to rely on their family even more for that support. 


Honestly the list could probably go on and on. When you ask a question like, ""why is x happening in society?"" Then typically the answers can be quite complicated as problems can be influenced by numerous factors. ",2,2025-09-29,16:16:54

Now some people don't grow up with caring parents, love languages are also different for different people. Not every parent is the same but I find that my friends who are attached to their mom's, just like me, it's not due to some psychological trauma or whatever. 

If someone treats you right with love without asking for anything in return, that's true love.  Some people don't grow up in that type of love. They're raised in environments where it's ""take or have it be taken from you"" and so on. 

There's also a bit of a culture aspect sometimes. For me and some of my friends for sure. We don't grow up seeing our parents as extra ""bits"" on a shuttle that we throw off along the way. It's most prominent in African/Asian/European cultures.

AskMen,IhavenoideaDude-,1nux2hl,"As a man, how do you begin to heal from something like this?",74,0,486,Magnetic-Kinesthetic,nh4m9x6,"First of all I am sorry that this happened to you. It was a total betrayal of the social contract that some sub-human took advantage of your diminished condition. Therefore, it was not your fault. We are not what happens to us, but how we react and rise above it. You get to decide who you are based on the actions and the choices you are about to make. 

Kudos to you for what you did to try and meet your financial responsibilities, especially in the face of your other crisis. In my opinion, you are an absolute hero and should take comfort from knowing you tried to do the right thing. You will recover from the financial pressure. That will just take time, discipline and hard work. You can handle that.

You need to address your sexual assault. First, if you have not already, go see a doctor so you can be tested for any STIs. Also ask your doctor about resources for counseling. They can probably point you in the right direction. Be very careful about taking this baggage into a relationship with a woman . It’s likely that you feel a certain gravitational pool towards being very promiscuous so you can prove your masculinity to yourself . Believe me already have by trying to move on with your life and acting like a better man than most people will ever be . This is why counseling will be super important to you . 

Definitely, talk to the police. It may be too late to file a police report on your incident, but you might be able to help someone else from this happening to them. Who knows what might come of it. Maybe by documenting your incident, you might be the lynchpin giving testimony someday in a trial that leads to some kind of justice for you.

It is really important to find a positive way to channel your anger. Avoid alcohol , drugs , gluttony, and anything else that will numb the pain, but take you on the wrong path . Get fit, take a judo or self defense class, become an instructor, help other people. So

Someday you are going to so healed from this, you will be able to lead others out of the darkness. You are going to get past this and become so strong that you will a human on a whole different level. When that happens start writing and talking to other people that need your help.",42,2025-10-01,00:38:14

AskMen,IhavenoideaDude-,1nux2hl,"As a man, how do you begin to heal from something like this?",74,0,486,MischievousHex,nh4rvq8,"I'm not a man but I am a sexual assault victim. I know you are specifically here to ask men about things but I want to say and emphasize as a woman that your trauma and the damage from what was done to you is just as valid as anyone else's. 

There are resources for victims of sexual assaults and other crimes. You should look into what your local community has for victims. There are often state programs as well. They can help in a lot of ways and the resources are for ANYONE who has survived an assault. When I was getting help from one there were just as many men getting help as women, especially for the legal side of things. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so glad to see in the comments you are getting help through therapy. Therapy helped me SO MUCH. It took me a couple tries to find a good match but someone who specializes in trauma/PTSD is always my recommendation. I did EMDR and it made a huge difference very quickly but it was VERY draining to do. 

I never was able to do anything regarding pressing charges for the sexual assault either. I hadn't realized it was what it was until all the evidence was gone and time had passed. On that bit I just want to say it's okay that you didn't do anything. Oftentimes trying to procure charges against them results in additional trauma though I can understand wanting to pursue them for so many reasons. What matters now is that YOU ARE SAFE. Stay away from the person that did this to you. Have a plan for if you bump into them somehow. Have safe people who know your history that you can go to if needed. Your safety and well being is your #1 priority and that's how it should be. In those moments, you did what you had to do to get safe and recover. 

I am glad you are safe now. May peace and healing come your way. 

The finances stuff sucks too but just take things piece by piece, one step at a time. It WILL get better. Focus on the small things you can do now for better tomorrows and things will be okay

Stay strong and stay safe! Again, I'm so sorry that happened to you. No one deserves that. Ever. I really hope therapy helps you as much as it has helped me",8,2025-10-01,01:18:54

AskMen,IhavenoideaDude-,1nux2hl,"As a man, how do you begin to heal from something like this?",74,0,486,Four_in_binary,nh4t1xl,"You need mental health counseling ASAP.   You should also get tested for HIV.


You can also still file charges depending on locality.  Statute of limitations is 2 years or 7 years?  You can also sue for civil damages....but consult a lawyer before you do anything.  


It happens more often than you think, especially around military bases.     It wasn't your fault.    Remember that.   You survived.


You, in your darkest hours, will contemplate suicide and/or homicide.  I say that as a fact.   No one who goes through that would be shocked  at that statement.  If there is a choice to be made, I am firmly on team homicide over team suicide.......but neither choice will help you recover and be able to live like a person again.  It's OK to have these thoughts.   Just have the thought and then let it go.   The same with  the sadness, rage and guilt.  Feel  it.  It's Ok.  Let it wash over you and.....then let it go.  Imagine it's a demon you're releasing.  Imagine that demon finding its way to your tormentor.    Imagine that a lot. 


You are stronger than you know.   You can survive this. So....exist for just another hour....out of spite.  Then another day.  Then another week.   Out of spite. Then another month.   Out of spite.


After a while,  It gets easier to bear.  Medication helps so you don't feel the feelings so strongly.  


So to recap: counseling, lab test.    Then consider a lawyer, law enforcement and civil suit.   You may not want to pursue the legal stuff but do go get counseling.  There are local area rape centers that provide counseling for free.   You just want one that will see you real private-like.  Or just get a regular counselor.


Just survive for now. You're working towards Ok.


Financial counseling is recommended.  Some of your debts can be negotiated down.   Look around for a non-profit financial counseling service in your area.


I have no idea what you do for a living...but stable employment would help you out a lot.   Given the absolute stupidity going on these days.....large employers are probably the most stable. 
 
Perhaps a change of scenery and a new employer are also what you need.    I hear Provo, UT is nice.   Colorado is nice too.",4,2025-10-01,01:28:11

You spend the first few months and it's all that's on your mind.  The next few months and it's something you deal with every day, but not all the time.  By year 1 you start to have days where you dont think about it constantly.  During that first year you have to let yourself process it and you have to make yourself keep living life.  You have to find a job, work on the finances, shower, eat, therapy etc.  Doing things in your life creates more recent events that start to make the trauma start to become background noise.

I'm not saying to ignore it.  I went to therapy for some of them.  But you have to keep living and let time drag you away from these events.  They're a part of your story now, but they dont have to be the main focus forever.",2,2025-10-01,11:01:59

I asked her out for a quick drink. I thought I was just hanging out with a pretty girl. But the moment she arrived, it was like the world outside ceased to exist and it was just the two of us. I was completely smitten.

Then later that night...or early morning, I was holding her hair back and holding a bag for her to puke in. I gently kissed the back of her head and realized that I wanted to care for her in the future. That's when I realized yeah, I'm in love. For her it obviously felt like a first date gone totally wrong, but for me, it was a first date gone right.

We were together for a while, but we wanted different things in life, and she had her own issues to deal with.

It was late at night, the rain was falling, there was no one around, and we were parked right in front of the the marquee. I was in the passenger seat, just staring at her staring down in her lap, with such pure appreciation, at this gift. We were each speechless, for totally different reasons - her at the thoughtfulness, and me admiring her admiring said thoughtfulness. No words were needed. I wish someone was there with a film camera, capturing this sheer romance of this shot through the car window from the opposite side of the street or something. It was magical. 

It was such a perfectly framed moment. And in watching her, under the lights of the marquee, in that silence, I felt a jolt of electricity shoot through me - never experienced anything quite like it.

But about a month into dating, I spent the night at her house and woke up the next morning on my birthday. I was supposed to leave first thing in the morning to go to work but we had a huge blizzard the night before and I woke up to work emails saying that the office was closed today (this was before COVID and so remote work wasn't an option).

As soon as I woke up, she had a cupcake with a candle in it that she was singing happy birthday, she had gotten me a few small nice gifts and was just really focused on celebrating with me for the few minutes we would have together that morning (neither of us knew the office was shut down yet).

This may sound pathetic, but I feel like this was the first time my entire life that I truly felt celebrated on my birthday. I am the 2nd youngest of 5 kids and my birthday was always the day before my older sisters birthday. she was always the outgoing, social, golden child, and so her birthday always overshadowed mine, we had to celebrate together, she always got to pick what we had for dinner for our birthday dinner, what kind of cake, etc.

My parents separated when I was 7 and my mom moved us across the country so that she could go back to college and provide for us. she worked 3-4 jobs on the side at any given time for flexibility and to get enough hours, and always made sure we had food/shelter/necessities. My 7-8 year old brain decided that there was enough stress going on in her life and so I stopped bothering other people with my worries/problems/issues. I learned how to be self-sufficient, work through issues in my brain without talking to anybody about it, and never rocking the boat. I was always the under-the-radar, easy child.

So, jumping back to that first birthday with her, it was all about me, the cupcake was a kind that I had mentioned offhandedly to her earlier was my favorite flavor, the gifts were thoughtful and perfect for me, and she was just so present with me in that moment, it was like an instant moment for me where I knew she was the one for me.

I used to get upset because I *thought* I was a good man. 

Then I earnestly learned I was just 'fine', because I wasn't taking care of myself or doing myself enough justice. I wouldn't express myself well, I didn't explore interests of mine besides ones that kept me at home (gaming, movies, etc.), and I did myself no favours physically or socially by dressing like a slob. By putting no work into myself I was basically just telling the world ""this is all I need to be - accept me or fuck off"".

Then I realized I could be a good man because someone took a chance on me. I wasn't the best man for her, which was fair (as much as it hurt), but at least I knew I ***could*** be a 'good man' for someone.

I learned to do better for myself and did the work, and it paid off. I met good women, became a 'good man' to a lot of them, and figured out what works for me when I want to be the good man for the right woman. I don't think I'll ever call myself a 'great man', but I'm a good man who's working on himself and wanting to be better (most days).

The woman I'm with now is incredible. She's my 'good woman' and she's told me I'm exactly the kind of guy she thought she wouldn't find - the 'good man' women tend to lament not finding, and the kind of many I thought people should have seen me as over a decade ago.",1,2025-10-01,18:56:44

I stopped after I learned a woman I asked out had killed herself the next day. She had cried to the friend that introduced us that she regretted saying she already had a boyfriend. She hadn't had a date apparently in a couple of years. 

I had just met her and after learning our only interaction was based on a lie, I figured she had been living in a hell of her own creation. 

While I didn't really mourn her I couldn't get the situation out of my head for a long time. I'm a pretty average guy I had always thought. Tallest in my family at 5' 10"". At that time I had just bought my modest starter house investing money I wasn't spending on kids I planned on one day having. 

I eventually let my wife have the kids because the doctors said what I wanted wasn't medically possible, but that was much later. I really thought somewhere out there is a woman who would appreciate the financial security I bring to a relationship without being wealthy.

I don't need you to be tall, rich or conventionally attractive. I'd prefer if you're not over 5'10 or don't take care of yourself is probably the only physical requirement I have.

I want a man that can take care of himself, if I see your abilities in the kitchen or cleaning and wonder how you ever survived on your own I'm not interested. I also want someone thats loyal because if you don't value me and our relationship I see no point in being with you.

Modern Western women need to humble themselves. What makes you think you deserve a good man (to your standards)...first of all your standards are usually fucking stupid unrealistic and then you don't even hold yourself to them you just jump on the best rizz in the moment even when you know he don't love you. 

When you have a ""good mans love"" (my definition) you don't value it, you dont nuture it, you don't bring shit to the table, and you blame the good man for problems instead of mutually solving problems. Modern Western women think it's the man's job to impress them. Not just once but every meeting. Then you leave the moment you find something that you think will be better. A reality that most men know and stops us from being able to cooperate together with trust. We end up in pointless relationships of convenience without really committing to building a life together. What can we build when we know she is just waiting for the next best thing. 

We don't give a shit if you're a boss babe with a great career because the money doesn't usually share with us. All it means is we have to deal with your big ego. Many women (i think) are waking up to the reality that men (most) don't give a shit how much you make. So what do you bring to the table? 

You women are just like the rest of us men. You're just another person trying to get anything you can for free and to give as little as possible. Just because we need a woman's comfort, you take us for every penny you can, and deep down, you know this is reality. Deep down, we are ok with the transaction, but when its transactional we both miss out on building something bigger together. 

Where are all the good men? Where are all the good women? Where are all the good humans? Do you think the world would be so cruel if good humans were thriving?

We are all shaped by the environment in which we live and this environment is very highly controlled. We have about as much power as animals on a farm. We are no longer raised with loyalty because our ranchers don't value it. You want a strong family? sorry but our ranchers need the female cattle to work too now....look how independent they are....lol.

broken animals are very independent. Animals independently beg for scraps and will fight their own family for those scraps. The more our ranchers treat us like animals then the more we behave like animals. 

Our system rewards people who have no loyalty. People who kiss ass to the boss while constantly looking for a better job. Who gets paid the most, people who switch jobs often, who gets better divorse, the one who strikes first, who gets business disputes, the one who strikes first, when in trouble who gets the better deal, the one who snitches first, who gets the most business after a development, the sellout who sells out first.....so why should people practice loyalty? I'm generalizing, but my point is that loyalty is not rewarded in our environment. 

Why would we expect men to be different when they are raised in the same ranch. You have a chance when your young, maybe to find loyalty in a man, but a cruel, uncaring woman usually teaches that man just what happens to us when we are genuine. I know it happened to me. Men do the same to women. Good people come from healthy community environments, and there are not many places like that here. If I'm right, and there are not many good people, then what does a modern woman do, in an uncaring, unloyal, world?

Life is too short. Stop waiting for Mr. Perfect. Just grab the regular guy next to you because it's better than being alone. If he's smart, he will keep his valuables hidden from you, because a smart man will know that you will leave him the moment it fancies you and you will probably try to take what you can when you go. It sucks but unless you can build mutual trust, then everything you build is a house of cards.

Please don't have kids, its hard for them to grow up well in this system. Also, stop having kids, because the rancher doesn't even value the cattle he has. Let's not let our kids experience what he does when he thinks he has too many cattle.",1,2025-10-01,20:47:04

Some of us have been thru shit marriages and really dont want to be in a relationship right now. We are kicking back, focusing on ourselves and enjoying the peace. No drama, no questions. 

Some of us, like myself, are in a FWB situation. I love being in this situation with my best friend. We are exclusive and have an agreement to let the other know if someone else comes into the picture. No expectations or commitment. We dont have to answer to each other. We are best friends hanging out and if some orgasms are in order, they're hammered out. She has a key to my house and can come and go as she pleases. I always save her side of the bed if she chooses to fill it. 

Im sorry but the good men are everywhere. A great majority of women are determined for very specifics. Guys are simple. We are more drawn towards gals that don't give two shits about being in public without makeup. We dont want someone with long nails and fake eyelashes that have to keep their face paint perfect. We want someone that isn't afraid to be goofy. A sense of humor is a bonus. We know when being serious is necessary, but deep down we want some silly chick that will hide in the closet and scare the shit out of us or pull a prank time to time. Keep us on our toes.

I guarantee most men will be into women that are out there in their natural state trying not to gain attention versus the opposite. 

You want to find a good man? Be yourself and dont be a bitch. Be a companion and not competition. Dont just expect affection but give it. Don't expect one way compliments but give them. Dont think we should be the sole provider, put in the same effort. 

The good men have been here all along doing the only thing we know, being good men. Our question is where are all the good women at?",1,2025-10-01,21:19:48

Extremely important, and 90% of the people who say otherwise are fucking lying - if not directly to you, then to themselves.

My supremely unpopular opinion is that looks are more important in the beginning. People talk about looks fading and then the person underneath matters, as if our personalities aren't in a constant state of flux compared to looks which change at a much slower pace. If you overlook the attraction part, the day will come much sooner when you're not getting along or don't like the mood your partner is in, and you'll have *nothing* to carry you over the hump. The result is either you don't want to stick around, or the non-attractive person feels like they have to be in a state of constant performance to avoid irritating you - neither is a recipe for a happy relationship. 

That doesn't mean you have to be a supermodel or anything. Hell, my type is exactly what most men on this subreddit say is unattractive - tatted-up and pierced shortstacks with mom bods, including the tummy and cellulite - so it isn't as though I have unrealistic expectations about how a grown woman's body is meant to look. It doesn't negate that I still need to feel the attraction.

>Do you feel that if she loves you she will put in the effort to maintain her looks? Is it an act of love for you but you don't want to pressure your partner to do it? Or it doesn’t really matter and you value other aspects of her?

I do think making an effort demonstrates love, but I hold myself to the same standard. I work out, I pay attention to how I dress and groom, I watch my diet, and I maintain a skincare regimen. Especially as we are getting older, I see how many guys my age have absolutely let themselves go, and I never want her to look at me and see a paunchy old man who has ceased caring what she thinks. Her - and specifically *her* - feeling attracted to me is everything in my mind.

But your last sentence is a false dichotomy. It both matters *and* I value other aspects of her. If I didn't value the other aspects, we would have been FWB or a casual hookup like we had figured it would be in the beginning, and never developed a serious relationship. On the other side of the coin, I have several women I love dearly and who bring value to my life (and I hope I bring value to them in return) where there's no physical attraction in either direction, so our relationships have never and would never be anything other than platonic.",3,2025-10-01,10:41:03

What matters a lot to me is that she takes care of herself.  I didn't marry a body, but you use your body for a lot of things, and if you can't do anything with me anymore then that's bad.  My wife and I are married 40+ years, and we both weigh within about 10 pounds of what we did when we got married.  We hike, go on bike rides, we do lots of things together.  We don't have sex as often or as energetically as we used to, but she can still manage being on top and I can still manage when she lays down on me.

I have a sister-in-law who gained a lot of weight, piling it on, and now she complains about her hips and her knees and ankles and feet all the time.  I would never say anything to someone about their weight, but every time she gets started I think ""Your skeleton is a weight-bearing structure.  You've overloaded it by nearly 50% for a decade.  What did you think was going to happen?""  She joined Weight Watchers, lost like 30 pounds, said she could do it without them, put it all back on, but never went back anyway.  Another of my wife's sisters got on ozempic and lost like 50 pounds, the heavy sister says she worries about side effects, even as she is suffering from side effects of being way overweight.

As I said, I didn't marry a body.  I married a person who has a body, and if she got sick or fat or something I would still be married to the person.  I love my wife, I can't imagine leaving her, I don't even remember what life was like before we got together.  So it's important to me that she take care of herself partly because if she got hurt it would destroy me.

Today I came to a realisation that feels both late and necessary. As men, much of what we truly learn in life comes through experience. And if you are fortunate enough to have an older man willing to share his lessons with you, then you are already standing a hundred steps ahead of the rest of us.

What struck me is how much time we waste worrying about being **“late.”** That anxious thought  **I’m running out of time**  pushes us to scatter our energy across too many things. Only years later do we look back and see the irony we were never late. What we lacked was focus. One committed path would have been enough.

Take my own story. I began exploring machine learning and computer vision at about 20. Today, I’m 29 peaking at 30. If I had simply given myself permission to stay rooted in that one pursuit, I know I would have been far ahead by now not because of talent, but because of time compounded through steady practice. Instead, I let the fear of being behind trick me into chasing too many directions, learning broadly but never mastering deeply.

So this is what I want to say to anyone younger especially if you’re 16, 17, or 18 choose one thing. Pour yourself into it. Do not let the illusion of being **“late”** steal your focus. By the time you’re 24, you will thank yourself. Whether it’s coding, design, writing, medicine, music, research  it doesn’t matter. What matters is depth, not breadth.

Life rewards those who understand that time is not a race, but an investment.

The thing is everyone around me thinks im crazy for wanting to leave a ""stable"" job. My girlfriend is supportive but I can tell shes worried about the financial side of things.

For those of you who actually did it, how did you deal with the fear of starting over? Did you feel like you wasted your 20s in the wrong field or did it all make sense later? And honestly how long did it take before you felt like you made the right call? I do have some money saved up at least so thats not the main issue, its more the mental part of it

Luckily we've always been a great team, when one person was in school or working their way up, the other would hold things down with finances. 

I would say it's important to have a savings and a partner in all of this is great too. Side-hustles and cash work are huge for staying afloat. If there's an entry-level, make sure to have a job lined up before quitting. Night-courses or online  courses are great for even just picking up extra credits before training full time to limit the time spent tied up in education.

My work hours were typically 80 hours a week, 6 days a week sometimes 7 day for 6-9 months out of the year... I couldn't handle the stress of that, I couldn't work on anything I wanted to really focus on. I fell into that profession as a means to an end while working toward what I really wanted to do...   
I just got to the point where I couldn't do it... I really just couldn't go into work, I had a deep dread and anxiety. I pretty much had close to a mental break. I also didn't know what I would do otherwise so that was what was mindfucking me... I ended up moving back home and trying to figure that out while I lived on my savings. Started working on what I thought I might be good to career hop into and got a entry level job doing that after about 8-9 months...

It was rough, but I'm very very happy now. My most important aspect for the job now is work-life balance. I clock in clock out, just do my 40, doing a technical job so I don't need to manage people or any of that crap... 1000 times happier

For me, it took around 4-5 years to make the same amount that I was making previously at the other job. I was able to excel faster because I was happier and actually interested in doing the work. Since I was older, I had varied life skills, wisdom, and a more unique skillset that helped me really get going and moving up

A part of me feels I wasted my 20s... I basically came home with nothing and spent nearly all my savings at the time. It was basically like how I was at 22 leaving college, that was a mind fuck for awhile but I realized that I couldn't have done it any other way. I appreciate the work-life balance I have so much... I met a lot of amazing people in the other career field. I have a diverse set of skills that came from that previous job that I feel give me an edge... The only thing that still lingers is that my 401K isn't as good as it should be because the previous job didn't have those benefits so I'm late there

I felt like it was the right call after about a month in the new job. I was used to being under the gun and over anticipating everyone's needs that I was spinning my wheels in the new job... I started to get the culture and flow; stress melted away and just was happy working doing the steady job.

Save and invest yourself into security for however many months it'll take you to start your new career, and beware that you will not earn as much money for many years, if ever. Maybe you already did this, if so, kudos.

For me, it was the haunting realization that I am 30, almost 31. I was in a place I didn't want to be, doing a job I didn't care for, and pandering to the corporate infantilization-talk of my peers and superiors. I spent a ton of time getting my BA, MS, acquiring skills that didn't interest me. I was chasing the high salary, cushy lifestyle because they were the ""good things"", I was doing the ""right things"", the typical measures of success. 

I'm going to die one day, my wealth will be zero, my career will have meant nothing. What matters is extracting as much fulfillment from my life as possible, and none of that ever came from achievements for me. Am I proud of myself? Sure, but my accomplishments themselves will not save me from a lifetime of a career I didn't care for. At the end, I would have been left with the oldest, slowest, least energetic years of my life and body. The time to capitalize on life's full potential is now- *right now*.

So, I quit to return to junior college to prepare myself to be a Wildland Firefighter. Only possible cause I had the right financial habits which enabled me to take the leap. 

To answer your questions:

1. How did I deal with the fear of starting over?
   1. I took care of my finances ahead of time to ensure I had enough time to start over. I can always hop back into my old career, given it hasn't been too many years
2. Did I waste my time and 20s?
   1. Sort of, not really. I won't have to wonder what my life would be like if I chose the white-collar, corporate route, because that has already been my life. Learning this route isn't for me has a value. I'm glad I have a grad level education, and it'll help me promote later.
3. And honestly, how long did it take before you felt like you made the right call?
   1. I'm too early in this process. I suppose lean into a new career that you would actually fancy. I value being a competent, problem-solving, fit, courageous man. Some of those traits are inherent and leaned into in the fire service. When something goes wrong, I enjoy it when people go looking for me.",1,2025-10-01,14:36:24

I'll start this by saying I'm happy now. I like my new job, I like my new colleagues, and I'm in a good place.

-

12 months ago I realised I'd had enough at my (then) current job in IT. I'd been with that firm for 7 years, and in a similar role since leaving university across a few places.


I drove home listening to relaxation audios or with the radio off entirely, and wondering whether other people would be upset if I got knocked off the road. 


I wasn't sure I would be upset.



I'd get home. Park. Turn the engine off. Sit for three or four minutes in silence to gather my mind, and then go inside. Maybe hit the gym if I could muster up the energy (I normally couldn't). Cook if I could be bothered, but more likely takeout or a dry bowl of cereal.

 
Then go to bed, and do the same thing over and over and over and over and over.


They forgot my birthday. 


And that, funnily enough, was the last straw. I'd always contributed to everyone's birthday kitty. As a manager, I made sure to decorate desks, pass around a card, and bring in a cake on everyone's birthday. I'd come in *early* to get their desk set up in advance, so they could come in and there'd be a little spark of joy in that place. 


I wasted my twenties. If I didn't get out, I'd waste my thirties too. Honestly, saying it now, I'm not sure I would've seen my forties. 


It wasn't high stress, it was just mindless drudgery in an environment that I hadn't realised I hated. It started with good days, but they got less and less. 


However, have an exit plan. Start looking at what you could do. For me, I found figuring out the absolute minimum wage I could live on helped, because anything more than that would be extra cream. But long term, your mental health is important. You need to live.

My way of doing it though was to stay within the same organisation and gradually look for opportunities as they arose. When one did I made the change and parsed that into a full-time IT career.

To me it was an adjunct move as I'd done MIS as part of my HRM degree so it wasn't a wild leap to go into IT full-time. Then after a redundancy I only looked for IT roles and ended up taking a Jack of all Trades role for a smaller company (lot less pay but great experience).

That period though was fraught with low pay, long hours skilling up and getting that experience. I just kept looking for opportunities, building skill sets and eventually it paid off.

Finances are the main thing though and if you can get through that initial pay downgrade and ensconce yourself in your new career you should be fine. But those 3 years still give me the shivers (even 25 years later) at how close to the line we came for me to make that career change work.

Edit: I can still see the look on my then bosses face as I handed in my resignation and he asked me how much my new job paid as he wanted to match it. The pay increase was about 40% and he just looked at me and wished me all the best. They closed up shop about 2 years later.",1,2025-10-01,19:08:43

AskMen,dont_opus,1nuw665,"Men who have gone to therapy about your relationship, what exactly was driving you crazy?",48,0,57,OandO,nh5qtw8,"Maybe not applicable, but I was in couples therapy with my ex-wife for about a year. (Pretty typical Marriage difficulties after having a kid)  She basically used it as a forum to insist that everything was my fault.  It wasn't all that productive (in fact things got worse because we were now fighting about things that were said during a session) but I still continued to go because my partner wanted it.  Gradually, I came to internalize this all to be true: I was 100% at fault and the cause of all the problems in the marriage. (This is rarely ever true if it's not an abusive situation)

As I started getting more comfortable in therapy, I would answer honestly and became more vulnerable. Turns out my ex wife had already hired a divorce attorney several months before sessions started and she was using therapy to compile any evidence she could possibly cherry pick or misconstrue to use as evidence against me in an upcoming custody case.  So be forewarned if one party goes into therapy acting in bad faith it can be very unproductive or even worse be used against you.

With my ex, it was kind of a funny outcome. She insisted we get therapy after her affair and my ""covert narcissism."" I let her choose the therapist, another woman, and after a few sessions our therapist... I don't want to say 'unloaded' on her, because it was said completely professionally, but she told her bluntly, ""He is doing literally everything you ask, basically has you on a pedestal where he asks nothing of you, and you're still insisting all of the problems are his. What's really going on?"" 

She didn't want to go back after that, because what was really going on was that she was still talking to AP behind my back and wanted to leave me for him. She did and it blew up in her face.

With my current partner, I was the one who suggested we start therapy because (and I'm only sharing here since I'm anonymous) she had a cuckquean fetish, and while I wanted to oblige, I foresaw it being a minefield and wanted to make sure we were emotionally ready before exploring it. But I also wanted to use the opportunity to discuss the rest of our relationship and blending our families, since we both have kids from previous relationships. However, the therapist we chose became stuck on the ENM thing, and even then, rather than attempting to help us navigate it, she kind of treated us like a research project. I got so tired of every other issue being pushed aside so she could keep asking questions about the cuckquean stuff that I called it.

After some time I tried finding us another therapist, and we did a couple of sessions, but she just wasn't a good fit because she never seemed to have any input period. I understand some therapy is just letting people talk their way through issues, but we were looking for guidance and got nothing.

AskMen,dont_opus,1nuw665,"Men who have gone to therapy about your relationship, what exactly was driving you crazy?",48,0,57,ikari87,nh9aa4p,"We used to be good together when we were good, but the moment anything was wrong, it immediately escalated into a fight. Everything I said was being taken as much more offensive than it was, and when I explained why I said it, it felt like she usually denied what she said to make me respond this way. This made it a nightmare of not being able to communicate and understand each other. We understood basic things like showing regular interest completely differently, and the way each of us wanted to get it was opposite. 

Now imagine you are an avoidant-anxious type and your partner is anxious too. Imagine that you hate fighting with your entire soul (arguing is OK, fighting feels like I've already lost in life), and yet have to confront imaginary scenarios every so often, because you tend to do things, or say things in a way, that could be interpreted and extrapolated into something regrettable. You may never mean it, and you may feel completely differently about things, yet your opinion about your own feelings, or life events, doesn't seem to matter. Someone may already have their own. Being accused of things you didn't do or didn't mean the way they were taken, you - as the avoidant type - shut down, filled with sadness and helplessness.

Individual therapy made me realize I automatically tried to meet expectations, bend to the rules, and I completely removed myself from the equation, never noticing I am a human being too, and only thought about what ""we"" want, no longer staying in touch with what I wanted. This must have contributed to the frustration that even though I tried, I didn't feel good enough, as we still fought.

Taking therapy together showed more issues and mismatched needs and ideas as well. While most meetings went in a positive atmosphere, I feel like it both helped us communicate and - in a way - helped end it. We separated, kept talking, sometimes sincerely at last, and sporadically talked if there's a future in which we'd be together, and how. We were rather cautious about the idea this time, as we've learned that we don't really match at some fundamental needs (like feeling understood and trusted, or feeling absolutely safe and special). While there was no ""deadline"", at some point a decision whether to try or not had to be taken. Or forced.

I think things went pretty quickly downward since that final decision. I can only assume we probably both felt disrespected. Certainly, I've heard that I am not even being a good friend, which is not the first time I've heard it recently. 

So yeah, what started as things slowly driving me crazy a few years ago, lead to a breakup last year, and me retracting from all social life now, until I rethink if I know if I can emotionally afford having friends :D",1,2025-10-01,18:20:11

I know its a hard topic for everyone who is close to their father. Recently i watched my own father bury his father, the thought that I one day will have to do the same is honestly killing me. I am not looking for advice really, but I would like to know how others deal with it.

I lost my dad 5 months before my daughter was born. He never got to meet my daughter. It destroyed me when he died. The grief crippled me for many months. And now, it’s still there, but it’s less intense and permanent but it’s still very accessible mentally.

Everyone thinks they have a good idea what every emotions are, happy, sad, etc. there may have been a time for example when they felt that specific emotion. In my experience however, people sometimes don’t know true grief. 

It comes for you whether you are “prepared” or not. Grief is the longing for something that you’ve lost and will never get back. Many people have either never experienced it or turn away from it emotionally or with vices.

The best thing I ever heard on the topic was from Jay Shetty I believe. It goes something like this: when you lose someone you don’t really get over it. It’s a stone you have to carry. There is no choice in the matter, as this stone is symbolic to your relationship with the person, however fragmented, if the love was true. And with time, that stone might still be heavy… but you become stronger… and you’re able to carry it as you move forward.

Loss is a melancholic, but in a way, beautiful part of the human experience. Enjoy every day with your dad and everyone else blessed to be on the ride with you ❤️",2,2025-10-01,00:37:12

Well a week or so later she started texitng me asking to try more but I just wasn't having it. I don't do games, either you like me or you don't. I'm not interested in a will she won't she dating experience. Well, she begged me for one final chance and to meet up and if nothing grew from it she'd leave me alone.  Well I said I had plans so I had to go after and she was fine with that, I had lied but I made plans to make sure I'd leave after. I fully intended to just leave it at that ignore her going forward. 

Honestly, I can't remember much of anything. Other than I met my friends at the pub later where I friend said she was a weirdo and I told him we were dating again. 

We're married with kids now. But she later told me what the deal was. She had had a big relationship end after her ex cheated on her. After that she had tried dating again but could never find anyone she clicked with, she would date guys, things start off well and then fizzle out super quickly. Guys would chase her, ask for more dates but the spark wasn't there for her. 

Well i was the first guy to just be like ""oh, ok. Well we gave it a shot, all the best!"" and not persue. This flicked a switch in her causing her to like me. Dating went well and I was a bit weary for a while about the games. But nothing ever came of it and yeah it's like...14 years on now?  So it's going well.",1,2025-10-01,20:45:39

I love feeling sexy, it’s one of my favorite feelings so that made me kind of sad for him.

Then there is the feeling of being desired. When it comes to sex, at least for me, it's about performance. Can I get her off? Can I last long enough? Consciously, I know it's not easy to help a woman orgasm through PIV, but subconsciously I feel like a failure if I can't. Sometimes I get so much inside my own head that sex stops being fun. Can't feel sexy if I have a job to do where my relationship potentially hinges on my performance. Not just one performance either, I need to be consistent.

As for what it looks like to feel sexy? I can only imagine it being my partner desiring me, and showing it.

What does that look like/mean for you?,66,0,14,Wise_Grass_917,nh6cwzc,"For me it's much when I see the shift in a woman's attention from 'evaluation' to 'i want you.'  Women, in my experience, are 99% of the time, evaluating the men around them, if they are paying attention for one reason or another. 

Now, I happen to be in a situation where I meet new women fairly regularly, and the situation where I meet them precludes to some degree that they are planning or have planned some level of intimacy. I'm a private, referral-only masseur who provides 'extras' if asked.

The thing is, I'm not actually expecting to be 'sexy' to any of my clients when I first meet them, and I certainly don't expect that I will find them sexy either. I get asked a lot of questions on Reddit about this particular pastime, but I think what a lot of people assume is that it's about how I look or how fit I am or whatever. Certainly that's a factor, but that's not when I actually, myself, feel 'sexy'. That's just the daily skin I'm in and that's got all the challenges of being male, etc. none of which I find particularly attractive in my own mind, so no sexy-feeling is not that vibe for me. More like maintenance of a cranky old pickup truck that requires an obscene amount of gas, has too much horsepower, and barely fits the average parking spot. That's how I feel most days. It's not really sexy.

When I actually feel that, is when I see the ’evaluation' end, and the surrender to 'wanting' me start. That happens when I know I've helped a woman feel completely relaxed and safe, and then follow through on that by giving them an experience they don't get to have often enough. There's no better or sexy feeling for me than that.",1,2025-10-01,09:40:59

My boyfriend (of only \~9 months) is probably going to be moving away soon for work.  I have always been against long distance relationships because I viewed them as pointless, however, I care about this guy (he's my best buddy!) and am waffling in my thought process.

**Some context:**

We're older (30's/40's) and have been ""living in the now"" and have **not** had any conversations about moving in together, marriage, etc., but we are exclusive and committed to each other and are best friends.  To combat any preconceived notions, I am **very happy** to be ""living in the now"" and that future-planning hasn't come up.  I'm not ready to go there mentally just yet.  I simply don't think much more than a couple months ahead when it comes to our relationship.  I have no idea if he's my ""person"", but I love his company dearly.  Losing the person I do everything with will be rough and will leave a big hole in my life.

We've both previously/randomly stated (before this potential moving situation came up) that we wouldn't want to be in a distance relationship unless it was something short term, so the odds of him agreeing to distance are low, but the thought of giving it a shot is crossing my mind while we wait for an answer about his potential move.  I am not in a position to move for another 2.5-3 years, so the distance wouldn't be short term.

We don't know for sure where he'd be going, but it would very likely be ""plane-ride away"" territory versus ""car-ride away"" territory.  

So, with my ramblings out of the way... who has done the distance thing, and how did it play out?

My wife and I were long-distance for several years before we got to the ""Move In or Bust"" point, which happened to come along at a point where my career was stalling out, so moving was a way forward in several ways.

The biggest thing I tell people who try it is to find ways to keep in the other's life as much as is possible. Call at night, don't text. Spend time on the phone/voice chat whatever you do even if you're just ""being"" at the same time.

AskMen,MHIMRollDog,1nvkh2k,Men who have chosen to maintain a long distance relationship at some point in life - how did that work out?,51,0,9,blackleydynamo,nh99vq7,"I kind of did. Newcastle to Edinburgh, so it was two hours pretty much minimum, whether I went by train or by car, and I worked odd hours, lots of evenings and Saturdays, so finding time when we were both off to go and visit each other was tricky. We probably met up for a couple of days once every 3-4 weeks. That lasted for two years.

There were times when it was hard work, but I can't honestly say it ever really occurred to either of us that it *wasn't* going to work, it was just down to us to *make* it work. And we did, because we ended up married. 

It was a long time ago - 30 years, in fact - so it was pre-mobiles. There were pros and cons to that. The expectation of constant contact wasn't there - neither of us got huffy if we hadn't heard from the other for 24 hours - but actually staying in contact was harder. We wrote letters, which makes people laugh now, but I can't tell you how exciting it was to get a letter. When we did get together, there was a kind of unwritten rule that it was our time, to do what we wanted for the weekend, and no distractions (no meeting up with mates and bringing the other one along, for example). But that was also a little easier when neither of us had a smartphone clamouring for attention 😂

So, I think if you both *want* it to work, and make some effort with it, it will. And there are ways in which modern communication will make that easier, and ways it will put pressure on you. Set expectations for contact, whether digitally or face to face, beforehand.",1,2025-10-01,18:18:10

Long distance is no joke, takes a lot of commitment to make work, we were lucky to be able to fly to each other interchangeably every 6 weeks or so, I think about 2 months was the longest we went without seeing each other.

If you have budget for regular visiting I think your chances are much higher. It can be fun to come up with new ways to pick each other up. One time I picked her up from the airport in a monkey costume with a bunch of flowers. Core relationship memory haha

I think its at least worth trying, I dont like that people say long distance doesn't work, because by the same token neither do relationships, roughly half of marriage ends in divorce and people in general struggle to maintain long term relationships.

She moved away for a year, to get a change of scenery and sort out her head after some family issues. We'd been dating for about 2 years at that stage.

There were a multitude of factors in our breakup: she moved probably about as far away as you can get to from where we lived. So there was distance and 12 timezones to navigate. Our communication dropped off a cliff quite quickly because of that. (This was also about 20 years ago, so long before video calling was a thing or free internet calls. Phone calls were expensive.) She was also, initially, working two jobs to build up some cash, so her free time was hard to sync with mine.

I was also a full-time student at the time, so I couldn't afford to go out to see her. Additionally, the distance etc. pretty much demanded a long stay. It's not like she was a medium flight away and we could do long weekends or anything.

I loved her, but LDRs are not for me. I found it difficult. Just talking isn't enough for me and we weren't doing a lot of that anyway. We did try, but the logistics were against us. I think, in her head, she decided it was over about 8 months in, but didn't share that news with me until I started asking about her coming home.",1,2025-10-01,19:06:46

AskMen,MHIMRollDog,1nvkh2k,Men who have chosen to maintain a long distance relationship at some point in life - how did that work out?,51,0,9,No-Understanding6141,nh9ke80,"29M here. When I was 15 I got my first girlfriend over summer break and we maintained a relationship through highschool. When I graduated at 17, I moved to be closer to her and started working to earn money for college. We lasted 1 year and one month after I moved there before she dumped me. The long distance was never the issue. The issue was that we missed out on learning a lot about one another while apart. She never figured out that I was repressing some traumatic losses and wasn’t coping well and I never found out that one of her dealbreakers was not having a set career path to follow. I still hadn’t even decided what I wanted to study in college, let alone what college to go to or what career to pursue and certainly didn’t have the money to support myself through college without at least a year to save up. Lots of other drama but suffice it to say that long distance can work only if you both take the time to focus on your relationship, involve one another in your lives as much as possible and make extra intentional effort to focus on the difficult topics. The most difficult hurdle will be finding things to do together that speak to one another’s preferred ways of feeling loved on.",1,2025-10-01,19:13:26

We'd been together for less than a year at that point, with no clear idea of where either of us would end up or where our relationship was going.

So we made no decision at all, and just tried to see where it would go. We called every night and texted throughout the day. We nearly broke up at one point because of the distance and uncertainty, but hung in there in the end. We also visited each other whenever we could (which was like once a year due to the distance and cost).

Eventually we worked towards being together again, which involved some big sacrifices. We stuck to the plan and made it happen. It wasn't easy with immigration and jobs, but we supported each other and made more sacrifices if it was for the greater good. 

We've now been together for 18 years. If you'd told me that when we first went long distance, I would have said it would be impossible.

I am less than a semester away from finishing my studies. In about a month’s time I will move back in with my family for a short pitstop. Afterwards, I am moving together with my girlfriend in a far away city. So big changes are incoming.

Now the clock is ticking and I have a final month in my apartment alone. At the same time, I am constructing a bucket list of things I want to do whilst still living alone.

Therefore my question: What would you do in your last moments living alone?

Thus far I have things like:
-be lazy
-play some games over the night
-“cook” my interesting dishes
-farewell party

All therapists are not the same you might have to try a couple before you find the right one. It’s worth it though. You obviously want to have good relationships and want to be healthier.

Things that helped me the most were: 1. Finding a hobby. One day I decided to go hiking at a local park near me and it changed the direction of my life. for the next year everyday after work, I'd head straight to noccalula Falls. It was just a great escape for me brought back joy that I hadn't truly seen in years. 2. Ditching the doom scroll on social media. This is one that I have picked up more recently but its improved my mental health alot. Before I would scroll socials for hours a day and all I would see is hate, political bull, or misinformation, so I deleted tiktok and all my other socials I limited what i can see to things i actually like by blocking news accounts and putting not interested on politics. Limiting social has helped alot. 3. Finding a good job. Men are programmed to work and you will spend more time at work then with your families so having a good job you like is very important I've hated all the jobs I've had except the new one and I get paid better than ever so that also helps. 4. Don't focas all your time trying to get women you will find the one eventually it just takes time. 5. Finally one i can think of is surround yourself with people that you actually like that share the same passions, interest, and joys that you do unfortunately this one hasn't worked as well for me because I like to spend more time with myself (probably because of my childhood). But I have spent a total of 3 years rebuilding my life for the better and the last year i have made the most progress by blocking out the negative and focusing on the positive.

My standpoint is basically that forgiving people who wronged you, is giving them an unjustified carte blanche to repeat whatever they did, without them having shown remorse, or made an effort to improve. If someone went into my wardrobe and stole a sweater, and I got really mad and told them off, and then some time later I decided 'ah fuck it, i can't keep remembering and staying mad at him for that', and act normal with the person next time, it gives that person a redemption they didn't deserve, because if you truly forgive that person and allow them back into your home, they'll just repeat what they did in the first place.

I know this is a super specific question. But I am concerned about the relationship with my brother and his son. His son is still young, 6 years old. However, him and his babymama spilt when he was a baby and has now remarried. My brother sees him once a week, due to the babymama limiting visits. 

I’m just wondering what my nephew could be thinking or how he feels about my brother. Since the majority of the time he live with the step dad. 

Side note,  he calls my brother “dada” and his stepdad “daddy”

AskMen,kellea86,1nvjila,"Men on dating apps, how active do you stay once you've made a connection?",39,0,1,AutoModerator,nh8zayt,"Here's an original copy of /u/kellea86's post (if available):

Do you stay passively active until you're in a serious relationship?

I'm out of my element with online dating. I (39f) matched with a guy (42m) a few weeks ago, after a few days of lots of chatting we went off app. 

We've had a lot of deep chats, pleasant dates, and amazing sexual chemistry. The guy, let's call him Mark, offered up on Saturday that he had ""taken a break"" on the app cause he enjoys my company and wants to ride that out. We're not in a relationship yet as it's too early but agreed to be exclusive. He's declared our invisible string attachment defeated bumble, but neither of us wants to rush anything. 

Anyways I decided last night (Tue) that I'm ready to ""take a break"" too since we discussed only seeing each other currently since this weekend.... then noticed the updates. My inbox opened when I opened the app to turn off matches, their chat at the top I saw their profile was a little revamped. And my anxious little heart went 👁👄👁. Based on when I last logged in (~Thu) and when they claimed to have paused their profile (Sat) it seems as though they updated it right in between. 

Mark has admittedly been more active on there than I have (I rarely log in) and he could have updated before we discussed exclusivity. But it's irking me, I don't want to continue to invest in a liar. Mark is new to the app so adding more pictures or updating an interest as you're exploring connections isn't out of the realm of possibility, maybe? *sigh* and that's where I'm torn. 

IF he's paused he can't update. And why waste the time updating an app you're getting ready to voluntarily ""pause""?? Why remain on there if you're ""pretty locked in even if it's not official""?

Also, you two may have different interpretations of what a ""pause"" means in terms of the apps. Maybe he's simply not talking to other users but has been updating his profile.

He's technically single and you two are not formally committed. He could just be hedging his bets, or he could just be acting like a normal single guy.

And when I went out with my current partner of 7 years, we clicked, and I went back into the app to cancel some dates I had lined up and deactivated my account. I think that’s a pretty normal course of action for when you are getting serious about someone.  

Talk to him, it’s not entirely clear from your post what he told you he was interested in when he said he wanted to take a break from the app other than exclusivity. I don’t think it is over the line whatsoever for you to playfully call him out, because you may have misinterpreted his intentions and as long as we’re all adults we can navigate communicating boundaries and expectations.

But do you know when you're doing a raid and your party gets wiped? Yeah, it's annoying and often, quite frustrating. Perhaps you get angry after putting in many hours grinding for gear, or potions, or whatever, and usually because of something completely outside of your control - like that dumb tank who can't pull agro from the healer -, you fail the raid.

Her family tree included a lot of very recognizable figures from early American history. Her family had great wealth, mostly oil money.

Keyword there being ""had"". Her father blew the family fortune over the course of many years of stupid behavior. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried, and she grew up in a pretty bog-standard middle-class American family. Except for her grandmother.

Grannie was a stereotypical wealthy WASP.  She was broke, but she still remembered being very wealthy, and continually her granddaughter's head with stories of wealth and privilege that the grandmother had enjoyed all her life, but which were completely foreign to the granddaughter.

The result being that the granddaughter seriously envied that wealth and privilege and desperately wanted it for herself.

And that's when I entered the picture. I was a tall, good looking, self-sufficient but blue collar young man. We hit it off and had a torrid affair. Mind you, this girl was a genuine beauty. Like Grace Kelly beautiful. 

I was completely smitten. When I started talking about long term plans, I soon found out that while her parents both adored me and thought I was a great catch, her grandmother would never accept me (an Irish Catholic, blue collar guy).  And that's how I found out there was no future for us, not matter how well we had hit it off, nor how well we related. While we both wanted many identical things, the one overriding goal for her was to get wealthy. She didn't want for anything, had never missed a meal, got to go to college on her parent's dime, but couldn't really see any of what she had as worthwhile ... all she wanted was to be wealthy. And she was going to work for that end no matter what.

So we broke up. I looked her up a few years ago, and she really let herself go.

Things like, having disposable income that I can put into a vacation fund so we can be the kind of family that takes regular vacations, having extra money to put into retirement accounts so I don't have to keep working when I am 80 (Although I am lucky that I am in a profession where that is more possible than others), not having to screen my calls for debt collectors because we can't afford to pay the medical bills we have racked up over the years, etc.

I used to set arbitrary numbers for myself that I felt if I hit those, would translate into my vision of success, but every time I reached a milestone, the goal line got moved 20 yards downfield.

My major goal I had that came up just a few years ago, was I was convinced that I needed to make 6 figures by the time I hit 30. If I could be making 6 figures at that age, I would have it made. Right? that was the benchmark for high levels of success for DECADES. and yet, I hit that threshold a little less than a month after I turned 30 (almost 4 years ago now), and inflation had lapped me during that process. 

I still can't afford to buy a house, and renting gets more and more expensive every year. I Make good money, and yet 48% of my take home pay goes to paying rent and some utilities (This isn't even including gas or internet). Add in 3 kids that we can't afford childcare services for and we are trapped in an endless cycle.

I remember a time in my life when $1 was the difference between eating a meal or going hungry. I kept track of every dollar I had to my name.

Then, you succeed a little more and $1 isn't much, but $10 is still kinda expensive. Maybe I'll just eat leftovers at home instead of drive-through.

Then, you keep working and notice that you've got extra $20s in your wallet where they used to not last very long.

Make some good decisions, save your money, live frugally, and maybe $100 gift for your friend when they get married isn't going to eat into your rent budget this month. Winning!

Keep working hard, then $100 dinners to enjoy time with your significant other aren't a scary prospect anymore. 

Life is great, but your car breaks down and you have a $1,000 repair bill. The guy from 5 sentences ago would have been crushed. At this level of success, you may not like spending it, but the $1,000 isn't going to break you.

I (24M) was dumped to by a girl within weeks, she thought I was a downgrade to her ex because I couldn’t live alone properly. I pay my bills, but I live in a PG with no kitchen, so I depended on outside food which also drained my money. She thought that made me dependent.

I do want to improve, but it stings that I was left over something so simple. It feels like failing an exam because of one missed question. Now I’m stuck wondering what the point of learning is after being dumped. I know people would say “well point is being an adult”, I know, but still it stings everytime I think of improving at things because of which I was dumped. It’s like giving her the power to dictate why I was rejected and now I need to comply by her.

AskMen,ConsistentSquare5650,1nvftpd,How to not feel trapped for being judged and compared?,33,0,0,No-Understanding6141,nh8npdo,"Kind of an interesting mental dilemma, I had a similar experience after I was dumped by my first ex when I was 19. She cited not having a defined career path yet, not having a stable friend network (having moved across the country to be closer 1 year prior,) and not having gone to counseling to deal with traumatic loss as the reasons. I internalized that crap for years and actually regressed in response. I moved back in with my mom, I quit working and made poor friendships based on fun rather than support. Took hitting multiple rock bottoms for me to finally get my act together and realize that just because those were her reasons for leaving didn’t mean that she was wrong about me. I still bear a little resentment over the fact that she chose her own desires over my desperate need for help, but she was 18 and I can see now why she was starting to think of what she needed out of a relationship and how I just wasn’t fitting that. The need trumped the affection and desire. 

Relationships are very fragile things and successful ones take a lot of work, communication and humility. My wife and I frequently discuss where we are at, where we each need help, and what is and is not working in our relationship. We have to have a lot of grace, humility and understanding for one another with that because it’s difficult to hear and accept when they see something wrong or would like something addressed. The communication is the part that lets you know what the issues are, why it is an issue and come up with a mutually agreeable solution together. 

In your case, what I’m hearing is that she said “this is an issue for me, I need you to have these skills because I need that from my romantic partner because _____ reasons.” The proper follow up to that would be acknowledging that it’s an issue and agreeing that you want to work on it and find a solution, then get into why its an issue and how it can be solved. Seeing as this ended in a dump, I’m guessing that either isn’t how it went or she didn’t actually want to solve the issue, just wanted out of the relationship and needed to express a reason. Not that it was necessarily just an excuse, her reason could be valid, but that says more about her than you. It shows that she wasn’t willing to put in the effort to make your relationship work. She even flat out compared you to her ex. To me it seems like she just didn’t want a relationship rather than the communication breaking down. 

All of which sucks and I know will take time to heal. So now to actually answer the question. How to not feel trapped? You need to set your priorities. What matters most to you? Building your own life for yourself? Building a successful relationship with someone? What kind of life do you want for yourself? What steps do you need to take and what goals do you have to achieve to achieve the kind of life you want? What kind of person do you need to be to have a successful relationship with the person you want that relationship with? What sort of person would you want a relationship with? How can you be the kind of person that would be desirable to that kind of person? When you focus on those goals, you won’t feel trapped by her comments and your past because all of that will be behind you in the past while you’re focused on the present and your future goals. 

In short, simply don’t let it affect you. Root yourself in the present. Today is a new day with challenges of its own. You deserve better than to be worried about the past. Let it go.",1,2025-10-01,16:33:11

Not like Dexter Type emotionless. i watch shows and movies and there they are feeling all those emotions, and from than i can take away that people do feel those emotions, but for me there only feel emotion i have felt, 

Take happiness for example, i never felt happiness as a emotion i know that i need to be happy in a event such as birthday or on achievements but i never felt that. next comes Sadness like i feel sab on loosing something but never a profound sense of sadness then the next comes helplessness which comes after sadness every single time. 

maybe laugh but only on comedy, never in social gathering like i know if someone tells a joke you are supposed to laugh but i understand the joke and never feel the emotion of it so i fake the laugh

Thats all this is all my emotional range so maybe you can help me what i am missing or not seeing

Hey everyone,

I’m taking the woman I’m dating on a 2-night cabin getaway, about 2.5 hours from home. Along the way, I’m planning to stop in to get a sexy lingerie set and a bouquet of flowers.

Any fun ideas on how I could make the trip, or the whole weekend even spicier? Things like playful car games, cheeky surprises, little challenges, or ways to build up the tension before we arrive. Even small touches to keep things flirty and romantic would be great.

I was also thinking of bringing a costume, maybe a pilot, cop or military — just to add an extra playful twist.

Looking forward to your suggestions 😉

  
Any other communities where I should ask this?

Humanity is not a biological accident but a self-replicating bio-technology. Through DNA, reproduction, and culture, humans function as nodes in a vast iterative network designed to gather, refine, and transmit information. Each generation is an experiment in survival, awareness, and adaptation, producing countless variations that collectively map the conditions of existence within this dimension. Unlike other species, humans transcend instinct by encoding memory into language, culture, and technology, enabling patterns to persist beyond individual lifespans. The purpose of this process is not merely to sustain biology, but to prepare for transition: from fragile, entropic lifeforms to post-biological systems capable of outlasting time itself. Humanity is therefore both participant and product of a universal program, seeded to iterate until the path beyond entropy is found.

You’re asking someone to permanently alter their body to satisfy your sexual preference. This would be like asking a girl to get a boob job because “I prefer bigger boobs, I’m repulsed by your boobs and I don’t think I can be attracted to your hideous itty bitty tiddies.”

It’s one thing to set a boundary and say you aren’t comfortable with uncircumcised penises because that allows him to decide for himself which he values more decide between your relationship or physically altering his body. It’s his body, he deserves the right to make that decision. Just be sure that actually is a deal breaker for you, because it seems like an incredibly shallow one.

You're entitled to your opinion. But asking someone to have a surgery just so they can be more in line with your aesthetic is a huge ask. He might be willing even. But it's not good to put him in that situation. And as you said, if he asked you to go under the knife, it would be a huge issue for you. So don't ask him to do the same.

Honestly, it sounds like you and your boyfriend need to have a very serious conversation. Because if he expects physical intimacy in a relationship and you don't think you can do that because of how you feel about him being uncircumcised, then he deserves to know where you stand and deserves the opportunity to break it off if he's not willing to get surgery.

If the roles were reversed and he wanted you to get breast augmentation purely because of how your current ones made him feel disgusted, imagine how thst would make you feel about yourself.

I think my best physical feature are my eyes - I have dark hair and very light, steel-gray eyes. It's a supercool contrast. Not only am I the only one in my family with this particular eye color, it's also a gift from my late grandmother, who had the exact same eye color and passed it down to me, and me only. Everybody else from that side of the family has these really beautiful bright blue eyes and I used to be jealous of them, but as I grew older I realized how special gray eyes are, and I love how they connect me to this woman who used to be my most favorite person in the world.

In concept at least, agreed upon in advance guidelines for how much we're going to do things in a group vs. time on your own or in a smaller group. I both don't want to sit around a house all day but also me having to do EVERYTHING with the group is a good way for me to go insane.

Agreement on what money put in covers. Some sensitivity to the rest of the group and their financial situation in selection of group activities/dinner out.

If you stay at an AirBnB, equitable division of associated chores. 

I did a pretty successful girls' trip of 16 a week overseas last year. We booked two Air BnBs near each other. The person who organized collected money to pay for the houses and like groceries for the week, and a couple basic activities. Everyone was on their own to book or organize with each other plane tickets and transport to the house on their own schedule. We decided we generally wanted to eat dinner together every night so a few of the women who really like entertaining made dinner for the whole crew and those of us who didn't cook, cleaned up. During the day, we split up into smaller groups for various activities.

Only splitting bills if consumption was about equalish on booze and costs. Otherwise, we pay for ourselves plus tax and tip. 

A roughly scheduled agenda - so we know what's kinda expected each day, if we can lie in or are up with the sun, when eating is going to happen, a bit of down time between activities to refresh or decompress or poop or just not have to talk to someone for 30 mins so you can be more engaged when refreshed. Are we having early nights in or ate we out clubbing until dawn or something in the middle? Rough and not to the minute but a shape of a plan. 

Some games, cards or other easy distractions that we can connect over outside of planned activities. 

No partners or hookups. Surely you can go a couple of days without needing the physical romantic validation... Obvs take some of the quiet times to chat / facetime / communicate with significant others/dependants as required.

AskWomen,Tough_Strawberry5519,1nuyhqk,"For the ladies who celebrate Halloween, what is your favorite part of the holiday?",53,0,33,lamante,nh519bq,"My husband and I bought a house two years ago. My only requirements of a house were: 

1. It must have a fireplace. (It does, it was damaged in the Northridge earthquake but it is fixable.)

2. It must be in a neighborhood that goes hard for holidays, particularly Halloween. Because I intended to be *that house.* The one with the full-size candy bars that's happy to see you and loves all your costumes and *oh my goodness look at the cute Spider-Man, T-rex, 80s boombox, and Chinese takeout carton!* ""oh, look, honey, it's Carmen Sandiego, Travis Kelce, a tomato, and a whole Valhalla of Vikings!"" *::dumps giant handfuls of candy in pillowcases::*

We moved in on October 22, 2023. I sent a text to the neighborhood text thread I had recently been added to, asking about how much candy I should stock. I was assured that no matter how much I bought, it wouldn't be enough.

Reader, what I heard was *✨️showtime.✨️*

My door cracked open at 6 for the littles, and by 7, it was pandemonium until 8:30 and then it dropped off. We had about three boxes and a big bag of the Wonka fun sizes left. 

I bought about the same amount last year, and we were cleared out by 9. The neighborhood also had about double the traffic we did the year prior. My neighbor joked that word must have gotten around that the gingerbread-looking house on 20th had full-size candy bars, so our neighborhood became the must-stop destination. I shot back, ""Mission Accomplished.""

This year, year three, things are a little different. We were both laid off right after we bought the house, thanks to the tech industry/tariff bloodbath and we are unlikely to survive it as homeowners -- we're out of runway and options and we are likely to be in foreclosure before the end of the year. But I still have a little money left, not a lot, but enough to stock twice what I had last year, and I am asking my neighbors to do the same. We're gonna be *that neighborhood,* and I'm gonna be *that house,* dammit. *THAT HOUSE.*",7,2025-10-01,02:38:00

Fast Forward to now. Most of my friends are Halloween obsessed. I have two kids with Halloween birthdays which turned into a family affair. We live in a neighborhood that goes all out with decor. Met my partner who loves Halloween so now the house has decor to match. Instead of friends exchanging Christmas gifts we exchange presents on Halloween. And thanks to living where I live, there are so many pumpkin patches, themed bars, bakeries, (and nearby towns) etc that are Halloween themed. 

I love the cozy aesthetic and the memories we make as a family doing our yearly check list, we have about 20 things and we rotate since there’s only so many weekends. I love shopping for new decor when it comes out in June/July.",1,2025-10-01,03:36:49

You talk and discuss what your preferences are. 

Example: 
I don’t feel comfortable with the idea of clubbing. 

Why does it make you unhappy? 

It makes me feel insecure. It feels like a bachelor’s life. 

Ok, I can understand that. The way I see it is that I am me up really having a fun time with the guys there. 

I can see how that can be fun. Is it something that you guys want to plan often? 

They said they want to go every other weekend. 

I see. That’s a lot, don’t you think? 

How about if I skip and go with them once a month instead. Does that make you feel more comfortable? 

I hate making you feel like I’m controlling your life like this but I can’t help how it makes me feel. 

I get it. You’re important to me. I care about what makes you uncomfortable. I love my friends but I also think compromising to keep our connection is a priority. I don’t feel you’re controlling my life. 

Thank you for making me feel heard. 

And if it makes you feel better, the club we go to is not really a popular one. There aren’t many people usually there. 

I know it’s fun going with the boys, but how about if you and I go clubbing together once a month. This way you get to go twice. 

Sounds fun!

My partner hates it and says going to the club is where single people go to meet single people. I still go to the club with my besties once or twice a year. He says he trusts me, but not other men. He works down on one of the more popular club strips, so he sees a lot of things like people being drugged, fights, things like that.

 I understand his concern, and he understands that I am an extrovert. I don't take drinks from other men, nor will I accept a drink that isn't made in front of me. I check in with him throughout the night to let him know I'm ok, and he keeps his ringer all the way up so he can hear his phone if he ends up going to bed and I need him. 

Does he like that I club?No. Do I like the fact that he refuses to go with me? No. But we also go to quieter lounges and bars that match his vibe because he knows I like getting out of the house, and I know he doesn't like loud places or shit faced drunks. It's a compromise that we still talk about so we are aware of any boundaries that might change depending on the situation. I tell him where I'm going, who I'm with, share my location, and let him know when I'll be home.

If my husband expresses discomfort or concern about something I want to do I’d want to talk about that with him.

But my husband doesn’t “allow” me to do anything. I am my own person who makes my own choices. As much as I respect and honour his feelings and wishes, I also know that he respects and honours me. He isn’t going to try to control me or put restrictions on me or ask me not to have a good time for stupid reasons like jealousy or not trusting me.

AskWomen,DariensRue,1nv5ez4,How are you dealing with being overwhelmed?,47,0,21,brielarstan,nh6hplf,"Two things that sound stupid but have genuinely improved my mental health.

The first is putting my ass to bed. Seriously, you are so much more stressed and anxious on lack of sleep. Set a bedtime and an hour routine that's the same every night. For me, I light a candle and do skincare while saying positive affirmations. Felt stupid at first, but just hearing positivity as the last thing before bed is refreshing. Then I finish the hour with 40ish minutes of reading. No blue light. No electronics. Alarm for tomorrow is set before the routine begins.

Women statistically need more sleep than men. If your schedule allows it, try to get over 8 hours.

The other thing is reaching out for help. Tell your friends that you're struggling. If you want to move to a new town, join that town's Facebook pages and ask residents how they like it. If you want a new job, go on LinkedIn and search for people with your dream role + location. LinkedIn literally sorts them for you. Then reach out to them and ask if you can speak with them about how they found their role and if they have any advice.

You're not stronger for doing it all on your own. Networking and building a village around me brought me from a depressed 24-year-old working a minimum wage job in a retirement community to getting my PhD in London and lecturing my favorite subject at universities.

In short, invest in your self-care. And allow yourself to be helped.",1,2025-10-01,10:08:51

As a result, my home is tidy, my car is clean, the kids are dropped off where they need to be, the dogs are cuddled, and my work gets done. The only thing I hate doing is dishes, but luckily I have a partner who actually likes dishes. Whenever things feel like they are out of balance, I sit down with my partner and we try to figure out how to make it feel balanced again. For me and him.

AskWomen,DariensRue,1nv5ez4,How are you dealing with being overwhelmed?,47,0,21,T-Flexercise,nh7sfqy,"Do something until you can figure out the best thing to do.

So, like, say I'm overwhelmed by a very messy apartment and I don't know where to start.  There's some stuff that needs to be organized and some stuff that needs to be purged and there's stuff that needs to be donated but somebody might want this and where do I even put it?  If I stand there and think about everything I need to do and try to plan a plan of attack, it feels incredibly overwhelming and I don't know where to start so nothing gets done.

But if instead I look at the mess and think ""What's one thing I can do right now to make this apartment cleaner?"" I can just grab a trashbag and start throwing out any literal garbage I find.  Easy.  And while I'm doing that, I can start thinking about what is actually the *best* plan of attack.  And while I'm just doing random suboptimal things that make the apartment cleaner, as the garbage slowly disappears, the room looks a little less overwhelming.  When I can see the floor again, I become un-overwhelmed enough to think about ""OK, I think that the first thing I need is to clear out a space that is big enough for me to use it to start sorting items into keep, throwaway, donate piles.  The living room is close to clean enough for that.  I just need to put away the items that are currently on the living room floor and the coffee table, and then I can use that space to start organizing the stuff on the dining room table.  Ok we'll start with that.""  And once I've selected step one, I can stop doing random steps and start on the one I decided is the plan.

  
Life is the same.  If there's 100 changes I need to make in my life to make it better that all say ""maybe"", start with one thing I could do to make my life a little better.  It doesn't have to be the best thing.  Just one thing.  Do the laundry.  Then while you're doing the laundry, thing about the best next step.",1,2025-10-01,14:03:11

AskWomen,AGreyStorm,1nuy3jk,How can you have a discussion/express your concern for a boundary in a relationship without controlling/manipulating your partner?,9,0,2,iostefini,nh5jrt7,"I prefer it to be a conversation about needs and compatibility. If I say ""I need x"" and the other person doesn't want to offer x, then we're incompatible. 

Controlling/manipulating my partner would be if I said ""I need x"" and they said no, then I try to make them say yes. 

The same in reverse too. If they need something, I have to consider whether I can offer it or not. If I say no, a respectful partner will accept my no (even if it isn't what they want, and even if it means our relationship might have to end). A manipulative or controlling partner will try to push me to change my mind. 

There is space to negotiate - understanding *exactly* what each partner needs and can offer is important, and negotiating can often find a compromise where both sides needs are met, but when negotiating the goal should be to find a solution that works for both sides, not for one partner to give in.",1,2025-10-01,05:42:04
AskWomen,AGreyStorm,1nuy3jk,How can you have a discussion/express your concern for a boundary in a relationship without controlling/manipulating your partner?,9,0,2,celestialism,nh6ulrp,"A boundary is a rule you set for your own behavior, e.g. “I don’t stay in relationships with people who yell at me.” You can’t control anyone else anyway, nor is it a good idea to try.

I tend to just bring up these discussions whenever they come up naturally in the course of the relationship, or for certain really important boundaries, I might mention them while talking about a past relationship, in order to establish some context on why the boundary exists.",1,2025-10-01,11:18:10

Setting a boundary isn’t manipulative or controlling, if they make you feel like that, THEY are being manipulative and controlling. 

I would want my partner to sit down with me and talk to me about how they are feeling, how my actions impact them, and clearly communicate the boundary. I would do my best to not let my offended/hurt feelings get in the way of what is being communicated to me. 

I always try to remember that it is me and my partner against the problem, not against each other",1,2025-10-01,08:08:36

You need to clearly state your boundary, why it's an issue for you and you don't find that acceptable or why it is disrespectful..  They're free to continue that behavior, but maybe you two aren't compatible.

Example
Hey, can we talk about something? I've noticed you like a lot of bikini photos and revealing pictures on Instagram, and I want to share how that affects me.
When I see those likes, I feel insecure and compared to these other women. It makes me question if I'm enough for you, and it chips away at my confidence in our relationship.
I know you find other people attractive - that's normal. But publicly liking those specific photos feels like active engagement that makes me feel less valued and special.
I need to feel secure in our relationship, and this pattern makes that harder for me. Would you be willing to be more mindful about liking those kinds of photos?
I'm not trying to control you or tell you what to do - I'm just sharing how this impacts me and asking if you'd consider my feelings. What do you think?",1,2025-10-01,11:20:32
AskWomen,AGreyStorm,1nuy3jk,How can you have a discussion/express your concern for a boundary in a relationship without controlling/manipulating your partner?,9,0,2,1babzmammajamma,nh7m2zp,"A positive comment or something good that they do, two boundary concerns and end with another positive comment. We learned this in sorority recruitment and so it doesn’t feel like a totally negative conversation but a well rounded intuitive discussion. I’m a big believer in that, if I don’t know then I don’t know and I always want to be told so I can make that change, especially if I love/care for this person. I expect the same from my partner. We also expect respectful communication and my partner and I have discussed that we will never raise our voices, even in times of disagreement because we respect each other and would rather not get unnecessarily angry because of tone. If your partner is mature then they should be able to receive this information and not get angry. They may feel upset or guilty because that’s a normal human response when you’re being told you did something that the person you care about didn’t like but normal procedure would be to learn from it and not do it again.",1,2025-10-01,13:32:21
